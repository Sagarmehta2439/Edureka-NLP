0,Auto, I have recently purchased a J30T with moderate miles  I shopped for a car that was looked after and paid more for it  As a former Auto Technician I know what to look for and what to expect yet every time I drive this car I say to my self  Dam that s a great car   and Yes I truly do  The car affords a level of style and comfort that is beyond compare for the price  I had looked at a number of J30 s with some having covered 160K miles   I checked them to see where the problems show  They were great other than just basic owner neglect The car is extremely quiet and smooth yet does not distance itself from a mild degree of sportiness  Performance is smooth yet impressive yet the power is well handled by braking and suspension systems of similar refinement The appointments available with the car were somewhat sparse yet the standard of quality and functionality were apparent  The Bose sound system for example has remarkable output and clarity without all the fancy dials  My only complaint  after 15k miles  is a lack of fold down rear seating and slightly high fuel consumption I went from driving a Porsche to the Infiniti and feel it was a step up in style and understated performance  ,0,I recently purchased J30T moderate mile I shopped car looked paid As former Auto Technician I know look expect yet every time I drive car I say self Dam great car Yes I truly The car affords level style comfort beyond compare price I looked number J30 covered 160K mile I checked see problem show They great basic owner neglect The car extremely quiet smooth yet distance mild degree sportiness Performance smooth yet impressive yet power well handled braking suspension system similar refinement The appointment available car somewhat sparse yet standard quality functionality apparent The Bose sound system example remarkable output clarity without fancy dial My complaint 15k mile lack fold rear seating slightly high fuel consumption I went driving Porsche Infiniti feel step style understated performance,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",-0.9676534173551042
1,Camera, I bought this product because I need instant gratification  I can t stand the torture of waiting for my photos to come back from the lab  and I don t want to pay extravagant sums for one hour developing  The Sony Mavica is the perfect solution for the click happy shutterbug who likes to take lots of photos  but doesn t have an in home darkroom or an interest in the nuances of traditional photography The great thing about the Mavica is that you can take a photo and instantly see how it turned out on the built in color LCD display  If it sucked  take it again until you get it right  Non digital cameras don t come close to offering this feature With film  you take the photo and cross your fingers  If it s a one time shot  forget it  When you re using the Sony Mavica  you can try a variety of shots  with or without flash  and look at the photos until you get what you want  You can take black and white photos or add a  quot sepia quot  effect that looks like an old tyme photo that you get at the county fair A standard high density floppy disk is your  quot film quot  and holds about a ton of standard resolution photos  great for internet use  and half that amount of high resolution pix that you can print out on your printer One criticism that I have heard about this product is that it does not produce the glossy  permanent prints that you get when you use a film camera  If you are willing to spend some extra money  you can get a decent inkjet printer for a few hundred bucks that  when used with special photo paper  prints photos that look a lot like traditional prints  If you go this route and are willing to learn some software  you will get permanent prints that are superior to those that you get from the photo lab You can correct red eye and other common problems  adjust contrast and color just as you do on your TV  and even remove your finger or the camera strap from the shot  You can print wallets and 8 quot x10 quot s to your heart s desire without paying for reprints  The newer Mavicas can store a minute long MPEG movie  complete with sound  And like I said  the photo lab people never see your photos  Start your own  ahem  website  Ooh la la The fact that this camera uses floppy disks poses a problem for some computer owners  People with Windows based PCs generally have floppy drives and can use the Sony Mavica disks  The iMacs  however  don t come with a floppy drive  You ll have to shell out some extra bucks for one if you want to use your Mavica  since I don t think you can connect USB cables like with some other digital cameras If you do consider a Mavica  take note of the useful features that you get with the higher end models  and be sure to get a decent printer and some photo quality paper to get the most out of your purchase br br  ,1,I bought product I need instant gratification I stand torture waiting photo come back lab I want pay extravagant sum one hour developing The Sony Mavica perfect

4,Camera, Minolta DiMAGE 7Hi is in a digital SLR with 5 megapixel 2 3  CCD sensor class  currently also populated by Nikon s Coolpix 5700  Sony s DSC F717  and Minolta s own DiMAGE 7i  Besides the high pixel count  these cameras  larger  better sensors and lenses  compared to 1 1 8  format and smaller digicams  result in better tonality  sharper images These days  it seems that digital cameras become obsolete the moment they are manufactured  Minolta DiMAGE 7Hi comes barely 6 months after the introduction of its similar looking sibling  the 7i What compelled Minolta to release an upgrade this soon  What makes the 7Hi stand out  Should you choose it or another camera in its class Minolta  one of the  big three  camera makers  besides Canon and Nikon  and the second most profitable one of the three  is the only one of the bunch that s been for a while without a digital 35mm format SLR body that would work with their lenses  Therefore  it appears  they feel the extra pressure to deliver viable  performance and cost wise  digital photography options to those of Minolta users who are advanced photographers This is very evident in 7Hi  It feels and works like a real photographic camera that happens to be a digital camera  as opposed to a digital age gadget that takes pictures that so many digital cameras are  Its performance  shutter lag  delay between you pressing the button and the camera taking the picture  frames per second speed and count for continuous shooting  time to ready after the shot  image retrieval  and focusing speed  are all at the top of its class   state of the art  7Hi s focusing system is fast and features an option for you to have the camera focus on any point in the frame   Things mentioned so far in this paragraph are all improvements on top of Minolta s own DiMAGE 7i s already impressive performance 7Hi s zoom control is a well dampened and smoothly operating ring that s mechanically linked to optical elements  allowing a very fast  precise  and tactile control of the focal length  By contrast  competitors in its class only offer a  zoom by wire   electronically emulated zoom ring  or  worse  T W zoom buttons  i e  camcorder style zoom controls  7Hi s high legibility display shows image histogram  distribution chart of light and dark parts in the image  in recording and playback modes  allowing you to monitor and optimize exposure  Its lens covers a span from the highly useful  relatively wide in 35mm film camera terms 28mm to the telephoto 200mm  with very little distortion throughout the range   Sony DSC F717 s lens only opens up to 38mm or so at the widest Overall the camera has a solid  quality feel  It comes from the shape and surface of the grip  and from how the various dials and controls operate  I ve played with the Minolta 7i and the Nikon 5700 at the store when I was picking the 7Hi  and to me  the 7Hi as a camera had the best feel of the three overall The camera works with Minolta s impressive flash system  including the powerful 5600HS  that even works wirelessly while preserving TTL   through the lens exposure metering  two excellent macro flashes  great for flowers   other close ups  and a cheaper and less powerful midrange flash  There s also a PC sync socket to trigger studio   generic flashes  no TTL with those though  but with a digicam  you do see the results right away  There are other features that are too numerous to mention here  that may come useful to some photographers Now that you know what s great about this camera  here s what isn t  There is some grain like noise evident in the images  This is especially visible when photographing smooth flat areas of a given color in subdued light  particularly if that color is blue  This is a typical and fundamental problem for all digicams  and I would say is not far out of line with the other prosumer 5MP SLR competition  but I wish 7Hi were the best in this regard as well  No video capture mode in the true sense of the word  I know it s a gimmick  but I like the idea of having a video mode on a digicam  even if it s a 320 x 240 pixels x 15fps for a few seconds  This camera s CPU speed and buffer size would with little doubt allow for at least 320 x 240 x 30fps or 640 x 480 x 15fps  both highly useful for the web streaming media  It s a shame that Minolta did not include this capability  they did provide 7fps capture at an even higher resolution  The capacity of the supplied CompactFlash card is pathetic  The camera battery performance  using the excellent NiMh batteries supplied with the product  is average by today s standards  I am typically getting around 200 shots per charge with my typical flash and AF use  and maybe 250 if no flash is used and no extensive focus   refocus   try again AF activity takes place  Fortunately  7Hi uses  4  AA s  so it is easy to get cost effective extra batteries  such as the ones recommended below  I wish they made the camera USB 2 0 enabled  It s USB1 1

8,Camera,    From Olympus to Kodak  b I enjoyed using an Olympus d450z for about a year  read my detailed epinion on this product to know more  but I eventually wanted a camera that would Give  easier access to manual functions   because the numerous steps needed to bypass the automatic functions of the d450z led me to use it like a point and shoot most of the time Offer a  direct USB connection  to download photos to my desktop and notebook Be more  sturdy   the lesser the plastic  the better Translate  accurate colors   my Oly d450z always had a blue tint Be  widely available   so that an eventual repair wouldn t leave me without a camera for months  which was unfortunately the case in my previous experience with Olympus Having access to higher resolutions  such as 3 1 mega pixels  wasn t an incentive to change my camera  but I eventually came to the conclusion that it sure wouldn t hurt if I ever want to have some of my works printed out After many price and features comparisons  I chose the Kodak DC4800  I waited to use it extensively before writing about it here  After two months of usage  I think I m ready to share my thoughts with you b  A success in design and ergonomics  b The DC 4800 s design is  in my opinion  a real achievement in ergonomics  All the accessible buttons are well placed on the casing  so you don t constantly have to look at what you re doing  after just a few minutes playing with it  your fingers will do the working The casing feels very solid  but the two plastic doors  for connectivity and the memory card  looks like they could break at any time  Also  the only button that I don t like is the power button  you have to push it very hard and low  probably to prevent unintended shutdowns or powering  and I personally prefer when electronic material that reacts to a light touch You could pretty well use this camera as a point and shoot if you d like to  But as the widely used manual settings have been put on the casing of the camera  you ll enjoy manually overriding the automatic settings  And contrary to many point and shoot  you don t constantly have to browse through a hierarchy of menus to set it up  Here are the functions accessible manually b Self timer   to chose the moment your camera will triggers itself b Burst mode   to take 4 pictures in sequence  at the lowest picture quality  you can take up to 16 b Landscape   to prevent the camera from focusing on a near subject and have the horizon in focus b Close up   To let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between 0 7 2 3 feet in great details   b Flash and flash settings   Will let you chose between flash  no flash  red eye b Exposure compensation   from  2 to  2  This will let you chose to over  or underexpose your subject  to adapt to various light conditions b Aperture   f 8  f 5 6  f 2 8  You can decide on the depth of field  so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photos  You can also choose P for the automatic settings to take over b Zoom  in out  You get a 3x physical zoom  and also a 2x digital  which adds up to the 3x automatically when you press the zoom button long enough  You could also choose to block your camera from entering the digital zoom mode  to prevent yourself from using it  I have yet to see a photo which benefited the use of the digital zoom  they re always grainy  not only with the Kodak s digital zoom  but with all those I tried I would have liked to access the ISO settings and exposure modes manually  but these have been put on menus accessible on the LCD  Also  the optical viewfinder could be a little bigger b  Limited memory for your memories  b The Kodak DC4800 comes with a 16 mb Compact Flash memory card  which is a complete nonsense for a 3 1 mega pixels camera  At 3 1 MP  you ll be able to fit  1  yes  ONE  uncompressed picture on it  If you compromise and add compression  you ll have 15  light compression  or 32  high compression  You could also choose to use less mega pixels  then you d fit  21   2 2  28   1 6 and 47   0 8 Needless to say that you ll soon have to consider adding another Compact Flash to your starting kit  I personally went for 48 mb  on which I can fit 5 pictures   3 1 uncompressed mega pixels  I rarely use it  48   3 1  light compression  63   2 2  85   1 6 and 143   0 8     Vivid colors and great details  b Let me now get to the main point of interest  picture quality  Kodak s digital pictures are known for their vivid colors  and the DC4800 reaffirms this reputation  The default color mode setting is at  saturated  which contributes to the vivacity of the colors  If you prefer  you can go for the normal mode  or even shoot in black and white or sepia You can also adjust the white balance manually  which will sure be very useful as I live in a country of snow  I m in Qu bec  I still have to experiment with this function  though  because I sometimes end up with a greenish tint on my photos when I override the default white balance settings Also  the 3 1 mega pixels will give you incredibly crisps and sharp details  even if you use low compression  but you ll eventually lose it if you use a high compression mode  which I don t recommend  The most annoying problem I had so far with the DC4800 is its inability to focus in low light conditions  It rarely focuses on the subject I want to photograph  but looks for any source of light and focus at that point  It gets annoying to have sofas and tables focused when people around are all blurry  As for the flash  it doesn t wash the picture as much as my Olympus  did  but still  I don t like using it  preferring to play with ambient lighting     Batteries down  down and down again  b My main complaint with the DC4800 goes to the battery  While AA NiMh rechargeable batteries in my Olympus d450z lasted for hours and hours of shooting with the LDC screen always turned on  Kodak s proprietary Li Ion battery that s used in the DC4800 doesn t impress me at all  If I keep the LCD on  it doesn t last more than 40 pictures  after which the LCD turns itself off  I can keep shooting without it for a while  but I don t like it at all  first  the optical viewfinder is too small  second  some of the main functions such as the ISO metering  shutter speed and white balance  are only accessible through the LCD screen  I suggest investing in an extra battery  consider the kit that includes a charger  it s 10  more than buying the battery alone  and it will recharge your batteries in 40 minutes  there s also the DC4800 expansion kit that will include the battery and charger  plus a decent carrying bag  a cleaning lens pen and an inkjet sheets sample pack   that s the one I chose and I m happy with it  The charger is very portable  and it won t be a problem to carry it around in your camera bag b  A few words on accessories  b b Neck strap   Useful to prevent dropping the camera  but it is so I d prefer a wrist strap  If you plan on using it  be careful  though  that the LCD may get scratched if you have hard buttons on your chest   b Lens cover    It falls down pretty easily  so you might want to consider fixing it to the casing with a small cord   b Lithium ion battery   This is a proprietary format  which is apparently also used in some other brands  so if you go on a trip b AC adapter for in camera charging   This takes very long  up to 4 hours  I strongly recommend buying a kit including a fast charger and an extra battery b USB cable   Perfect to transfer the pictures to most recent computers  Mac or PCs b Video out cable  for viewing pictures on TV  Never used it b KODAK software   It installed like a charm on my desktop computer  but my Sony Vaio couldn t go through the whole installation  I ended up installing the drivers manually  searching for them on my desktop and copying them one by one on the Vaio  Painful operation  but it now works perfectly on both computers  When evaluating the cost of the DC4800  consider you ll very soon what to buy these extra accessories b High capacity Compact Flash memory card   consider at least 48 mb b Expansion pack for the DC4800   item 1174770   100  You ll get Li Ion Battery  Li Ion Battery Charger  Premium Camera Bag  Inkjet Sample Pack  5   4 x 6 sheets  and a Lens Pen  You could also go only for the battery  70  the battery and charger  80  As you can see  for only 20  more  you get quite a lot with the Expansion pack  which I recommend strongly You may eventually consider buying extra lenses  in which case you ll also need to spend 25  on the lense adapter  it came as a promotion with mine  ,1,From Olympus Kodak b I enjoyed using Olympus d450z year read detailed epinion product know I eventually wanted camera would Give easier

10,Auto,    General Trooper Information  b The Isuzu Trooper has been produced for over twenty years worldwide  and is respected in many countries for it 146s off road prowess and reliability  Sadly  it hasn 146t received such a warm welcome in the United States  and was canceled in 2002  There 146s only one thing I blame for the downfall of the Trooper  and that would be the Consumer Reports hack n slash job on the 1996 Trooper  Their story was the ultimate Naderism  and caused such a furor that sales on the Trooper fell abysmally  After various strategies and incentives failed  Isuzu canceled the Trooper in 2002 due to lack of sales volume The 1994 Trooper I own is considered a 3rd generation model  and it was produced from 1992 until 1997  There were several option packages available  from the basic Trooper S up to the fully loaded LE  Just as the  a href content 82526768772 b Rodeo  a  was cross branded as the Honda Passport  so the Trooper was marketed as a Acura SLX  You 146ll find the same powertrain and most interior pieces are the same between both models  Since the resale value on both models is about the same  you may want to look for an Acura since they did have more gadgets and marginally upscale interiors  The Trooper is much easier to locate since they sold at a much faster rate than the SLX b  My Trooper Experience  b My Trooper is a 1994 Trooper S V6 with the 5 speed manual transmission  It has only the standard options  which makes it quite loaded by 1994s standards  It had 89K miles when I purchased it  and was it very good condition  I have since added an alarm system  remote keyless entry  custom wheels and tires  and an upgraded stereo system b Overall Appearance  I really like the way the 3rd generation Trooper looks from every angle  especially my all white version  The LS models had two tone paint jobs  with the bumpers and lower cladding a different color  The overall look is tall and muscular  with the obvious priority being interior space  From the back the Trooper looks quite large  as the rear door area is quite square  The side view puts this SUV in better proportion  as you can see the large hood offsets the bulky body  The only ugly parts on a stock Trooper are those hideous wheels  I really wonder what some manufacturers are thinking when they specify wheels for a new model   147Well guys  we know people will never agree on what looks great on our new SUV  so why don 146t we choose the most ugly wheel in our catalog  Then they 146ll HAVE to buy new rims 148 Isuzu should take notice of the wheels Jeep puts on their Grand Cherokee and Wrangler models  subtle yet stylish  The wheels on the Trooper are dished inwards  and look like an oversized pie pan only inverted  I chose to add  M B  Motoring  Shock wheels in a 7 5 148 x 16 148 size  These put my tires about 1 5 148 wider on each side  and let me fit 245 75 16 Nitto Terra Grappler tires without a lift and still have no rubbing  The rims and tires are obviously not necessary  and were purely personal preference  I will say my Trooper looks much nicer with its new wheels b Interior Appearance   Comfort  The inside of the Trooper takes a little while to get used to  For one thing  a 6 146 tall man will have 6 7 148 of room above his head when he sits down  This SUV does have loads of head room  and a very generous amount of leg and knee room as well  This goes for the back seat too  and the rear seat is also wide enough to seat two adults for any length of time in comfort  For some reason the front seats are slightly firmer  and give you better support over long distances  On a 1300 mile trip this fall  the back seat passengers were always asking to stop before the front seats  As I said before  it 146s not the room that is the problem  but more the composition of the seat material The dash controls are laid out in an fairly accessible manner  and most functions are easily reachable without focusing on them too much  The learning curve for the controls can be steep for those of us used to American vehicles  The main problem you might run into will involve the wiper and headlight controls  For some reason  Isuzu decided to put them both on the dash instead of the steering column where God intended them to be  After almost 10 000 miles of being the sole driver of my Trooper  I still turn off my headlights when I mean to turn off the wipers  It doesn 146t help that they are both exactly the same size and shape  A lesser annoyance is the placement of the main cruise switch and the rear wiper switch  They are placed on either side of the steering column on the dash  and right behind the steering wheel spokes  You have to feel around for them at night until you are familiar with their location Now for the good points  the 5 speed shifter feels very smooth for a truck transmission  One thing that seems so unimportant but which I 146ve really come to enjoy are the pull handles on all five doors  Just slide your hand into the handle and pull out  no thumb jamming or button pushing required  I also appreciate the lighted window switchgear  it 146s a nice touch for those dark nighttime drives  Standard power mirrors are a nice feature on any base model SUV  but Isuzu went the extra mile with heated and folding mirrors  The heaters are selectable with a handy on off switch  and those narrow garage doors are easier to navigate when you push the mirror button and watch the mirrors fold into the door  Power locks allow you lock or unlock all five doors from the driver 146s door  and simplify the entry of multiple passengers  Fit and finish on the interior materials is mid level at best  but still acceptable for a mid 90s SUV  The cloth is a very stain resistant material  and much nicer in cold weather than leather  The interior of most Troopers will be the dark gray theme of my truck  and it 146s great for those too lazy to clean  Tan and black both show the dirt much worse than gray  so three cheers for monochromatic color schemes  I really prefer the lower end interior trim instead of the fake wood and rabbit fur trim on the  147high end 148 LS  I 146m driving an import SUV thank you  not my grandparents Olds 88 Regency Brougham  Since I don 146t have kids of my own  I can 146t comment on child seat installation  but the rear doors do open wide enough to comfortably stand in the opening to position your kidlets in their seats  The 3 rd gen Trooper is too old to be equipped with the LATCH child seat system  so you 146re stuck with the old seatbelt rigmarole The rear seatbacks are adjustable  which is a rare feature in this class of SUVs  They recline far enough to get comfortable and rest  To fold the seats down  you only need pull the recline button and move the seatback forward  This will bring the seatbacks to a level position  but they most definitely don 146t fold into the floor  You 146ll have to wrestle with the seat bolts and remove both rear seats for maximum cargo capacity  This isn 146t a job you want to assign to your wife  since both rear seats are heavy and bulky  Normally this isn 146t a problem  since there is a large amount of storage behind the upright seats  The rear doors are of the 2 3 1 3 variety  with the larger left door opening first  This is preferable to the  147dutch 148 doors on Suburbans and Astro vans  Usually I only need to open the left door  so access is easy with the large opening  There is a latch on the bottom that locks when the door is fully open  which is useful on a hill or when it 146s windy outside b  Performance   Handling  b The stock 3 2 liter V6 is adequate for everyday duties  and is surprisingly gutsy up to 35 mph  The 188 ftlbs of torque are to thank for the Trooper 146s low end grunt  but 175 hp isn 146t quite enough for this 4 300 lb truck to cruise comfortably on the freeway  The onramp acceleration speeds are acceptable  but nothing to write home about  Above 75 mph the Trooper 146s design elements begin to work against it  Its boxy shape gives it a lot of cargo room for its size  but also endows it with the aerodynamics of a barn  Side winds buffet the Trooper slightly more than other SUVs  although it feels unsettling more than dangerous  After driving my Trooper at least 5 000 interstate miles I 146ve found it rides better with a medium load  which is evidence of the truck based body on frame design  I can say the Trooper rides much nicer than Isuzu 146s  a href content 82526768772 b Rodeo  a  mostly due to the coil sprung rear axle  Coil springs generally give a more progressive suspension movement and a better  more compliant ride  This is definitely the case with the Trooper  and this helps to keep the hideous potholes at bay on the frozen roads of the Midwest  Brakes have an excellent feel  and stop predictably when needed  Braking distances seem to be average for an SUV  although 4 wheel anti lock was only an option in 1994  Handling is better than you would expect for a vehicle of the Trooper 146s size and height  While it does have a large degree of body roll  it will stick to a corner at much higher speeds than most will want to attempt  Slalom type maneuvers are accomplished with moderate body sway  and a little drivetrain shudder  The emergency lane change was where Consumer Reports nailed the Trooper for rolling over  and this was later proven to have been a biased report  Other auto magazines attempted to recreate this situation  and failed to achieve a rollover  While this is essentially a truck  and it has limitations like all SUVs  I don 146t consider the Trooper any more prone to rolling than any other SUV of the mid 90s  One more thing  the 1998 2002 models were heavier and consequently had a higher center of gravity  so the earlier models aren 146t as top heavy as the newest generation  I would choose the 5 speed manual transmission over the automatic for this vehicle  since the auto robs more power from the merely adequate engine  It also does not shift quickly or firmly  and feels very sluggish in city traffic b  What About The Competition   b The Trooper 146s main competitors are the Toyota 4Runner  Jeep Cherokee  Ford Explorer  and Chevrolet Blazer  The 4Runner is admittedly a better vehicle  both in fit   finish and in quality  The 3 0L six cylinder engine is comparable in both power and real world performance  It 146s definitely smaller inside  so both passenger and cargo space suffer  It also costs up to twice as much used as a Trooper  You get what you pay for  so for those on a budget the Trooper is going to look better Jeep has been working on its Cherokee model for almost 20 years  so even in the mid 90s it was a well sorted out vehicle  I 146ve had the pleasure of riding in several Cherokees  and these are my conclusions  The Cherokee is by nature a better off road vehicle  and can tackle incredibly difficult terrain in stock form  It has a better auto transmission  and when equipped with the 4 0L inline six will perform very well both on the highway and in the city  Where it falls behind everyone else in this class is interior refinement  A 1994 Cherokee still feels very much like a truck inside  and rides like one too  For a family that needs 4WD and a strong frame based vehicle  the Cherokee deserves a close look  Anyone that will see most of their miles on the highway should head towards a 4Runner or Trooper  which are both better asphalt SUVs I haven 146t owned a mid 90s Ford Explorer  so I can 146t give you factual data for a comparison  I do know some casual friends that have owned them  and reactions are mixed  While cheap to repair like most American made vehicles  90s Explorers will be having more than their share of breakdowns by this time  and this is proven by their poor reliability scores  They also have a propensity to rust under the doors and around the rear wheels  I would personally recommend the Explorer to someone The GM Blazer Jimmy twins were always popular in the northern states due to their relative low cost  and the fact they were available in 4WD and several body configurations  While they do carry a reliability history somewhat better than the Explorer  it 146s still a notch below Jeep and the imports  Many of the interior features feel  147cheap 148  even on upper end SLT models  For some reason GM can 146t seem to design a seat that is comfortable for long distances  or include heated   folding side mirrors    one point for Isuzu   The GM twins strong point is definitely their 4 3L V6 and transmission  If you like speed and need to tow a reasonable sized trailer  take a closer look at the Blazer Jimmy twins b  Trooper Negatives  b It 146s not all roses for the Trooper  and there are some rather annoying issues that plague other Isuzu models  The geriatric 3 2L engine is actually sourced from GM  and is not what anyone would describe as a modern powerplant  It has a notorious valvetrain ticking problem that while not a true reliability problem  it can be downright annoying  Another problem that has plagued both my  a href content 82526768772 b Rodeo  a  and Trooper is poor quality lock cylinders  These locks just won 146t work right  and replacement is somewhat expensive  You must resort to unlocking other doors and reaching across the truck  or get the cylinders replaced  Since the Trooper and the  a href content 82526768772 b Rodeo  a  share the same manual transmission  it 146s no surprise they share the same parts failures  The slave cylinder for the clutch apparently fails at around 70 80K miles  and slowly leaks until your clutch won 146t disengage  This is exactly the opposite of how a bad clutch feels  when the slave cylinder fails you can 146t get your truck out of gear  You can put a band aid on the problem by having someone  147bleed 148 your clutch line and get all the air out  Eventually you 146ll need to fix it for good though  and it should cost between  250    350 to get it repaired Gas mileage is surprisingly bad for my Trooper  and I average 14 mpg  I was getting around 12 for most of the summer  until I put my tires up to their max air pressure  Now I 146m getting closer to 17  with a few dips down to 13 or 14  This can 146t be considered good mileage by any means  and you don 146t get the power of a V8 that the mileage suggests you would  I attribute most of this to the lower gearing and aforementioned barn like aerodynamics  The last problem I must mention is the timing belt noise  If a Trooper you own or one you are looking at has a loud clacking or tapping noise  it could be the timing belt tensioner  This is a common problem with these engines around 100K miles  and should be replaced whenever you have your timing belt replaced  The tensioner is a hydraulic dampened spring that keeps pressure on your timing belt  this removes any slack from the belt and prevents it from jumping on the pulleys  The hydraulic portion fails after so many miles  and causes the tensioner to cycle in and out rapidly  This can sound just like an engine bearing or rod slapping  but is significantly cheaper to repair  Depending on labor costs  you are looking at  350 to  500 for timing belt and tensioner replacement b  Final Comments  b Even though the above negatives may sound daunting  you must remember that every brand and model has their own chronic defects and failure areas  The Isuzu 146s are usually very reliable  and if something fails it 146s usually a part that won 146t leave you stranded  If I had to do it all over again  I would still buy my Trooper  even with its little quirks  I have enjoyed the storage and passenger capacity the Trooper offers  There are several useful Isuzu forums if you have questions about your Trooper  although the Isuzu dealer network is sorely lacking  I wouldn t say the Trooper is for everyone  but I would give it a strong look along with the other SUVs I have mentioned  The Trooper pulls ahead of its competition in the areas of value and cargo space  Check out the fanatics at the Isuzu Trooper Owners Guild if you want more info on Troopers http www

20,Auto, First of all  this will not be a review containing horsepower information  0 to 60 stats  true gas mileage charts  etc  There are plenty of reviews out there that do a good job of covering that information  This is my female review of the 2002 Chevy Trailblzer  I knew I wanted my next car to be an SUV  Monitarily  I found myself looking into the Mini SUV market  I test drove the Ford Escape  the Jeep Liberty  the Hyndai Santa Fe  etc  But somehow last Feb  I found myself buying a 2002 Chevy Trailblazer  The 2002 Chevy Trailblazer is a completely new body design from General Motors  They must have seen the need to compete with the Explorer crowd and increase the size of the Blazer  The Trailblazer is in family of similar GM SUV s  GMC  Envoy  Olds  Bravada  Buick  Rainer  soon to come Getting into the Trailblazer  you feel like you are in a beast of a car  well coming from a Pontiac Grand Am  you do  There is plenty of legroom in the front and back  something the mini SUV s lack  The seats are big and comfortable  The dash isn t too over powering like some of the GM mini vans from the 80 s  You sit up pretty high Now for the test drive  I had a limited exposure to full size SUV s  I drove my friend s 2002 Envoy  her nails where wet  and another friend s 2002 Ford Explorer  he was under the influence  So I was pretty much an SUV virgin  It took a bit getting used to sitting up so high above everyone else  Turning was also a HUGE issue  I felt as if I was going to tip over with every corner I took  Luckily that feeling is now gone  and I haven t tipped it over I ve been told I m an aggressive driver   I like to get going as fast as possible  as soon as possible  Here I am  in a HUGE SUV with only a tiny V 6 engine  I ve always made sure my cars were atleast a V 6  My lovley 90  Olds I drove in high school had a beefy V 8  Now I d be lying if I said this thing flies off the line  Don t try to race any Mustangs  But overall it has the pick up I need for my driving style  Now onto the 4x4 option  Being in Michigan  we splurged for the 4x4 LS version  Never having a 4x4 before  I had NO idea what to expect  Most of this winter was snowless  so I didn t utilize the 4x4 much  But it did come in handy when we did use it  Traveling back from the UP at Thanksgiving  we drove into a near white out  My husband flipped the TB  as we call it  into AWD and took off  no slipping  no sliding  To test it we flipped off the 4x4 and definetly saw the difference The LS version of the Trailblazer comes with some nice features  The CD radio is decent  With no speakers in the rear storage area  you can t get the car  bumpin  but it fits our needs 99  of the time  I LOVE the dual climate control  My husband can bust into a sweat when it s 10 degrees outside  where as I can have goose bumps when it s 70  So having the ability to control our own heat ac is nice  3 cup holders in the front  is a feature I love  Having only one cup holder in the 99  Grand Am  makes you really apperciate 3   The 2 cigarette lighters  well one lighter  one port  make it convient to be charging a cell phone and running a radar detector  The large map pockets on the door are handy for storing CD s  maps  papers  books  etc  The middle console  or hoofer as we call it  is nice and deep for lots of storage  It also has grooves for holding CD s if you prefer The middle row of seats have their own features too  There are an additional 2 cup holders that flip down onto the  hump  The middle seats also have their own climate control panel and cigarette  port  The middle row seats flip in a 40 60 split making it convient to haul boxes  skis  bookcases  10  trees  etc  done all of them  There is also a small amount of storage available under the seats The rear cargo area is nice and roomie  It features a  hidden  storage compartment  There are also to side storage compartments  The rear cargo area also has the 4th cigarette  port  The back hatch has strap to add in pulling it down  from inside or out  The back hatch also has the option of just opening the rear window  The back window also has a rear wiper  One thing my LS did NOT come with but we added on later is remote keyless entry  I STRONGLY suggest you get that option  The rear hatch can only UNLOCK by key  To lock the hatch you have to use the car s main locks  VERY ANNOYING Here I sit  one year and 30 000 miles later and I m still as in love with my TB  Like I said  I was pricing mini SUV s at the time  so getting something like the TB  with as much as it offers was a great surprise  After the GM discount  thanks Uncle Tim and Mom  and the  2500 in rebates  we drove off the lot with a 2002 Chevy Trailblazer LS 4x4 for the same price as a Ford Escape 4x2  ,0,First review containing

44,Camera, Aiptek Pocket Cam 3mega I have tried out this camera on a sale or return basis and compared it with a cheap 0 3mp camera and the Fuji FinePix2800  I was considering it as a present In summary I would say that the Aiptek is far superior to the 0 3mp pocket cameras as they are only just useful for small pictures on web pages  The Finepix 2800 however has high quality pictures in still mode  excellent macro and close up features as well as a reasonably easy to use menu system  So this new camera was always going to be given a good run for its money By comparison the Aiptek has only a poor close up facility so don t try to take pictures of your prize flowers as single heads  Its closest view was about 45cm  When trying to photograph documents it just did not achieve the resolution to make an A4 or A5 document readable  The Fuji had no problem with anything down to the size of a large postage stamp  One problem with the Aiptek is the burn out when using the flash on fairly close range objects The Aiptek has three resolutions 1mp  2mp and 3mp  When shooting a 30x25cm picture that filled the frame the Aiptek produced only a mediocre quality picture even at 3mp  with or without the flash  The Fuji did an excellent job  despite working at only 1mp Long and middle range views in good light were fine The movie mode on the Aiptek produced a clearer image than the Fuji with a truer balance for artificial light  Although the Aiptek uses the faster compact flash cards to store images the need to use this camera in the 3mp mode means that it still takes several seconds to make the camera available to shoot  especially if using the flash as well The Aiptek menu system is very straightforward and should not take long to learn Power is supplied by 2 AA alkaline batteries that come with the camera The standard memory card is 16mb but I would always recommend at least 64mb The camera is quite a handy size and  being the size of many mobile phones  will fit into the pocket or handbag The zoom lens is only 3x  I soon missed the 6x optical zoom of my Fuji  Also the zoom mode was disabled while using the movie mode and there is no sound with picture  unlike the Finepix The viewfinder is like to old compact cameras   i e  it has the same problem with parallax  Whilst this makes it clearer than the Fuji s electronic version it does make it harder to frame the picture accurately The viewfinder on the back is only slightly smaller than that of the Fuji  It is large enough and bright enough to operate effectively in most lighting conditions  It is a little harder in very bright sun but that is common to many other viewing panels on other cameras Overall I will return my review model and go back to my good old Finepix 2800  This Aiptek is easy to use and a handy size but does not seem to be good value to me and the resolution is well below what I would have expected for 3mp  ,1,Aiptek Pocket Cam 3mega I tried camera sale return basis compared

82,Camera,   Describe your experience using this product When I use this camera it is mainly to take pictures of my friends and special lifetime events that go on like going to parties or other fun functions  I use it completely in lieu of a normal 35 mm camera and it operates just as easily  I think its great because on the little screen in the back you can tell if you blinked in the picture  and if you did immediately retake the picture so you dont have to wait to get the film developed to find out that the picture was horrible because you blinked or put your head in a weird position and got a double chin etc  It is great for that purpose  When I try to take pictures of my dogs with it though  is where I found that it isnt so great they arent the most patient of subjects  They often will not hold the pose as long as a human so the picture is all a matter of luck    Why did you buy this product I got the camera as a gift for graduating from college so I could document my travels after graduation  It is perfect for that  I took it with me everywhere and have great quality pictures from everywhere I went  It was lightweight and easy to carry around with me everywhere so I didnt worry about it at all  In fact  I had it in my small purse and didnt even remember most of the time because it was so lightweight    What do you love about this product Obviously so far you can tell that I love the picture quality  and the lightweight and ease of use  The camera is great for amateur photography  or just documenting your life    What do you hate What I dont like about the camera is that I have had it for a short amount of time and have had to buy the batteries for it 4 times already  Of course some were completely my fault like for leaving it plugged into my computer overnight so it drained the batteries keeping itself awake  or when it opened the slide front when I didnt have it in a bag in my purse so the camera was just sitting there waiting to take pictures but just the same it is irritating because the local radio shack doesnt carry the batteries in stock so I have to order them The other thing I dont like is the inability to zoom into things really far away  One night  I saw a picture of the moon that was absolutely amazing and wanted to take a picture of it to use as my background on my monitor  I took the picture and got it home only to realize that all I had was really sky  the moon was so tiny that you couldnt even tell it was really there  ,1,Describe experience using product When I use camera mainly take picture friend special lifetime event go like going party fun function I use completely lieu normal 35 mm camera operates easily I think great little screen back tell blinked picture immediately retake picture dont wait get film developed find picture horrible blinked put head weird position got double chin etc It great purpose When I try take picture dog though I found isnt great arent patient subject They often hold pose long human picture matter luck Why buy product I got camera gift graduating college I could document travel graduation It perfect I took everywhere great quality picture everywhere I went It lightweight easy carry around everywhere I didnt worry In fact I small purse didnt even remember time lightweight What love product Obviously far tell I love picture quality lightweight ease use The camera great amateur photography documenting life What hate What I dont like camera I short amount time buy battery 4 time already Of course completely fault like leaving plugged computer overnight drained battery keeping awake opened slide front I didnt bag purse camera sitting waiting take picture irritating local radio shack doesnt carry battery stock I order The thing I dont like inability zoom thing really far away One night I saw picture moon absolutely amazing wanted take picture use background monitor I took picture got home realize I really sky moon tiny couldnt even tell really,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 20, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 12, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1]",-1.3769584427601917

110,Camera, Having looked around the Web for a digital camera I was looking at either the Z1 or the Canon EOD300 Rebel  Unfortunately the Rebel was out of my price range so I bought the Z1  Overall I made a very good choice The camera takes good pictures in the majority of circumstances  You can have full control over the aperture  exposure and focus should you wish too  The camera can take over some or all of the functions too if you wish Low light shooting is easy and there is an option for sunset preserve to keep the warmth of a picture rather than overexpose to simulate full light  Fast moving objects need good light  as you would expect  but the camera can still operate at speeds approaching 1600 ISO  the speeds are quoted in seconds and fractions so you will have to convert to ISO yourself if you are that way inclined Night shooting is an exercise in steadyness and the threaded mount is inline with the lens so tripods are easy to attach and use with the camera  The position of the trigger means taht a decent push is needed often spoiling the shot through movement on the tripod  I tended to use the time delay function after lining the shot up  since the exposur time was generally 2 seconds you wouldnt be able to take moment in time shots anyway as you would blur  however if motion blur was wanted for a set time then the lack of a remote may hinder you The flash was good with the red eye reduction setting annoying  3 distinct flashes are used rather than the usual strobe  but effective The viewfinder shows a full picture but it has an obvious border so you will get more than you see  The LCD screen shows the full picture  observed by me not scientifically proved  The viewfinder and LCD screen are served by the same mechanism and therefore cannot be activated at the same time  Long exposure shots are restricted to 10 seconds maximum  the sensor simply cannot take long exposure  I typically call long exposure at least 1 minute with traditional cameras taking maybe 30 minutes onwards  This is not a fault of the camera as most digital cameras suffer the same fate of  overheated  CCDs  Only the EOD300 can have long exposures  I have seen a 10 minute exposure picture  for a budget camera 10x optical zoom is terrific and even the autofocus at maximum zoom is quick and efficient  A certain knack needs to be adopted with the camera since the shutter trigger is a two position button  A half press will continually focus and a full press will take the picture  therefore if you simply press the button the shutter will appear to be slow since the focusing mechanism will kick in before the picture is taken  If you are anticipating a fast shot then half hold the button to activate the autofocus then the shutter can be activated quickly  Usign this methods the camer was faultless and fast I have never been a fan of megapixels to rate a camera  Rather the resolutions on offer are good and true  2048 scale very well   but dont expect many per a 128Mb card never mind the bundled 16Mb  Colour reproduction is faithful on daylight shots and average for evening shots with maybe a hint of overglow Battery life is great on rechargeables  I got 300 shots from a set of 2100 NIMH before they needed charging and I was using autofocus and zoom a lot  however if you use alkalines then expect 200 before the batteries are drained   note they wont be useless  good enough for remotes or clocks  but they have lost the edge for the drain the camera needs For negative points  the build quality is average  The mechanican shutter jammed on my only 1 week into using it  I couldnt shift between LCD and viewfinder and a heavy press was needed on the back screen to release the shutter  Not good  The battery compartment seems VERY flimsy and I worry about breaking it everytime I use it  and I charge my batteries in a smart charger not internally  No AC supply is included but the majority of people who need one will have a regulated supply to hand anyway The lack of remote function is the only noteable omission from a rather useful bargain camera  ,1,Having looked around Web digital camera I looking either Z1 Canon EOD300 Rebel Unfortunately

160,Auto, Before I get into my review of my 1994 Chevrolet Astro  I feel the need to say that I LOVE THIS VAN  In all seriousness  it has probably been the smartest purchase of my life  It has faithfully served myself and my four boys for seven years and over 160 000 miles  and continues to give me everything I ask for in a car with the same quality it did when it rolled off the dealer s lot I purchased the van in late 1994  as a dealer closeout at a rock bottom price  For the premium LT  luxury touring  model on the extended body and all wheel drive  it was mine for about  24 000  A little bit expensive  but when I looked down the street at the Dodge Grand Caravan  a more car like and more stylish model  I found that for a premium trim  comparable equipment  with all wheel drive  the sticker ran well over  30 000  It seemed like a no brainer to me what the smarter deal was  I gave up the more car like temperament of the Grand Caravan but kept  6000  in my pocket  Although it s not as stylish looking as the Chrysler built minivans  its strengths lie in other areas  One of these such areas is the powertrain  4 3 liters of high output V 6 engine serve up 200 horsepower and over 250 pound feet of torque  This translates into smooth around town acceleration as well as easy highway merging and two lane passing  The four speed automatic transmission with overdrive is a perfect match for the engine  with it s crisp shifts and an overdrive gear for quiet highway cruising  The fabulous all wheel drive system has never left me stranded in snow  sleet and ice and provides a notable advantage in handling and balance on dry roads The Astro is a body on frame van  which means that its bodywork is bolted to a full steel ladder frame  This is good for towing   don t ask me why  but I do know that the Astro is rated to pull over 5000 lbs  Compare that to a maximum of 3 800 lbs  for Chrysler minivans  The exceptionally spacious interior is also well suited to highway cruising  with it s comfortable seats   especially with LT trim  Standard seating is two front captain s chairs  power on the driver s side  with adjustable lumbar supports and headrests  my particular van came with second  and third row split folding bench seats that have folding center armrests and outboard headrests  Although they are a little on the heavier side  these bench seats are easily removable to open up 170 cubic feet of cargo space The one thing I cannot emphasize enough is the durability of this minivan  160 000 miles later  and with only normal periodic maintenance  it still functions as it did the day I bought it  The body is in perfect condition  I only wash it about twice a month and wax it about twice a year  and the paint still has a glossy shine to it  The interior has taken the abuse my four boys and I have dished out to it in stride   the scotchgard treated cloth seats and carpet resist stains surprisingly well  and the seat cloth shows no wear spots  The suspension has never needed any repairs save for one set of leaf springs  considering the amount of loading and towing I do  this is nothing short of a miracle  and still provides a comfortable ride  The engine starts up with absolutely no hesitation  even on a below zero morning  runs smoothly  quietly and without complaint  and most importantly  has never failed me   something I cannot say about my 1995 Voyager   read my review and you ll know what I m talking about However  even I have to admit that this van has it s pitfalls  Nothing in life comes without a price  and the price that comes with this van is the lousy gas mileage  I have consistently averaged between 16 and 17 mpg with this vehicle  This is no doubt attributable to the large displacement  for a V 6  truck engine and the all wheel drive system  The control panel also leaves a lot to be desired  The first generation instrument panel of the Astro placed climate controls to the immediate right of the gauge cluster  which curiously includes a voltmeter and oil pressure gauge but not a tachometer  and the sound system in the dead center of the dashboard  This is inconvenient for two reasons   1  The front passenger cannot comfortably reach the climate controls  and 2  The driver cannot comfortably reach the sound system  In 1996  Chevrolet updated the Astro  to include a new dashboard layout which features easy to use rotary climate control knobs and new Delco sound systems  The final downfall of this vehicle is the substandard crash test scores  NHTSA rated the 1994 Astro as three stars  average  for the driver and one star  very poor  for the front passenger in their front impact test  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety also dealt the Astro a sickening blow with its 1996 40 mph offset crash test  which produced extremely poor results  To see the results of this test  visit the following URL  http www hwysafety org vehicle ratings ce html 96024 htm  Although this test was conducted on a dual airbag equipped Astro  the offset crash test is more demanding on the structure of the car rather than the restraint systems  so the results of the 1996 test are largely applicable to earlier models  The lack of a front passenger airbag  a standard feature on Grand Caravan and Town   Country  certainly did not help this along at all  A passenger airbag was added in 1996 along with the aforementioned redesigned dashboard  As I have never been in an accident with this van  knocking on wood here  however  I cannot attest to the real world crashworthiness of this vehicle  Prospective buyers should note  however  that Grand Caravan received four stars  enough to earn a  good  rating  for both the driver and front passenger in 1994 Regardless of the vehicle s flaws  it has done a commendable job of transporting my family and I see no signs of it ceasing to operate anytime in the near future  When it does  however  I ll be back at my Chevy dealer  looking for a new Astro  I recently drove my friend s  02 Astro LT  and I noticed all the positive attributes of my workhorse as well as some new features I would enjoy  As a final word  I think it goes without saying that this van has certainly lived up to my expectations  and I would certainly recommend it to anyone searching for a functional  spacious  capable minivan  UPDATE  1 6 2004   Dad  come out and look That was one of my 16 year old twins  pulling into the driveway after work the other day  I went to the front door and he was standing by the Astro  with its driver s door open  Puzzled  I went over to where he was standing and looked into the vehicle  I didn t notice anything out of the ordinary  I gave him a strange look  and he pointed to the instrument cluster  This time  I took notice  The mechanical odometer indicated that the van had been driven exactly 250 000 miles  Wow  It is a small feat that the van has even made it this far  but it is nothing short of a miracle that it has done so with little more than routine maintenance  I still change the oil every 3 000 miles  which happens about once a month  with MaxLife synthetic oil  the transmission gets flushed every 25 000  which is about twice a year I would prefer every 12 000  but at  99 a pop  my wallet prefers otherwise  and I add a can of Restore at every other oil change  I started using Restore at about 185 000 miles  and the car literally feels like new again  My nephew  who is my mechanic of choice  dropped the car off at my house after installing new brakes  practically gushing at how well the van runs  Even though the van now serves mostly around town duty  like grocery store runs and my kids driving back and forth to school  I have no doubt that I could hop in and drive across the state  or even across the country  with no problems  This van has certainly earned its place in my garage  Long Live The Astro  ,0,Before I get review 1994 Chevrolet Astro I feel need say I LOVE THIS VAN In seriousness

if no human had graced its presence  all maintenance records were in order and detailed  This car was supposed to last me until I landed my first job  and then some  But it didn t  Granted  the car ran flawlessly for the first six months I owned it  but then it began to turn against me  The radiator went ka boom in the middle of Boston  the air conditioner was so powerful it turned the car off  if I was going up a hill  in winter  I had to turn off the radio  heater  and rear window defroster to have enough power to climb the hill  It was an under whelming car The car soon began to die a quick death and that s when I was on the lookout for another car  Again  another of my father s coworkers decided to assist me in my quest for reliable transportation  Ha  Anyway  this friend had another friend who had a Saab for sale  And for the sake of story  let s just say that this friend of a friend was shifty The Saab was kept at this friend of a friend s work  a Sunoco station where he was a mechanic  He showed me to the car  It was covered in  clever  bumper stickers and there appeared to be a young tree growing through the engine bay  But I was hopeful  sanguine  I took the key from his meaty hands and turned the ignition  The car grumbled to life right away  I shifted into first gear and drove around the gas station  a very thorough test drive We told him we would take it  The cost was  900 The mechanic who owned the Saab said he just had to find the title at his house and that he would pass it along to my father s friend who in turn would pass it along to my father who would hopefully pass it along to me One month later I received the title  It was a little suspicious  The name signed on the back was not the mechanic s name  but a woman s name  And then there was the date  The date was off by 10 months  dated 10 months earlier  What happened  Was there some sort of shift in the space time continuum that I was not aware of I brought the title over to my insurance agent and she looked the title over and said   Well  the Registry probably won t even notice  in fact  if they do  they will just assume she s old Okay b The Bad Saab Mechanic in Newburyport  MA  He was a bad man  a real bad man  Here s my little story  My car wouldn t start  or more accurately  it started but intermittently  As my spider sense tingled I determined that this was a problem  So  I drove down to my trusty local mechanic and relayed to him the problem at hand A few hours later I received a phone call from the very same mechanic  my mechanic  He stated that he didn t really know what was wrong with the car  He confessed to me  although I am not a priest and he is not Catholic but Muslim  that he didn t work much on Saabs but that he had the name of a very good Saab mechanic As soon as he revealed to me the name of this Saab Master Mechanic I called and told this Swedish automotive sage my story  After concluding the phone call I was on my way to Newburyport  almost 13 miles from my house Two days later the Saab Master Mechanic called my home to tell me the car was ready  After much excitement and washing of hands  I asked my father for a ride to the garage to collect my car  Little did I know what was in store We arrived at the garage a short time later and the Saab Master Mechanic greeted us warmly  He grabbed the keys to my car and showed me what I had hoped for  the car started  right away  the first try  Victory was mine Then the bill came What the problem was with the bill was not the price  it was actually low  especially for a Saab  but there was an extra item added into the grand total that called my attention  a towing charge b A Very Short Play  ME What s this towing charge  I drove the car here SAAB MASTER MECHANIC Well  I often drive home the cars I m working on  and your car died in my driveway  and I had to have it towed ME You re charging me for your tow SAAB MASTER MECHANIC Yup ME But I told you the car was having trouble starting  Why would you drive it home SAAB MASTER MECHANIC It s how I work ME But that doesn t seem fair SAAB MASTER MECHANIC Alright  you don t have to pay the towing charge  and if you don t  you can never bring the car back here again At this point my father interrupted and said   Okay  fine  here  and paid for my towing charge  I never went back to the Saab Master Mechanic  On the way home I stopped by my regular mechanic and I told him   Look  I don t care if you have to work from a book  I m not going back to that Saab guy  I then told my mechanic what had happened at the Saab guy  My mechanic apologized for the unpleasantness I experienced and said he would do his best with my Saab  What a guy  And boy  did he make some major mistakes b Radiator  Starter  Alternator  Battery  Fuel Pump  and Breaks  Unknown to me at the time  my newly purchased Saab had been dormant for quite some time  Dormancy is just about the worst one can do to a car  Parts  major and expensive parts  corrode and deteriorate  I drove my Saab for approximately one month before it turned against me  several times First  the radiator went  No problem  I got a used one off dad s co worker and dad installed it  Thanks daddy  The starter was next  which was misdiagnosed by my mechanic  and I ended up with a new alternator  Then the starter was replaced  but this was undermined by the fact that the battery was now dead  Off to the Sears Auto Center I go  Die Hards  please  Now the car could produce and use electricity  Another attack on my bank account quickly followed as a faulty fuel pump  the one in the gas tank Saabs have two fuel pumps  choked my car into submission and left me stranded at work on a cold New England winter night  Daddy b Final Tips and Good Things about Saabs  50 50 reliability  Saabs either last forever or fall apart  That s just the way it is  Of course  people of higher incomes will have a much better time with their Saabs since they can afford the high maintenance bills If you re buying used  make sure that the car was well maintained  Of course  this goes for any car  but with Saabs it s especially true Saabs don t rust easily You too can often put high mileage on a Saab  I ve seen Saabs with well over 300 000 miles on their odometers  and they weren t even being being towed Join a Saab club and learn to do some repairs on your own  You can get factory parts for cheap  real cheap  This will save you money  lots of money Comfy seats  It s like driving around in your living room  if your living room is very small and encased in sheet metal The engine doesn t leak  Despite the fact that my car had all these aforementioned mechanical problems  the engine itself was always reliable and never leaked Spacious engine bay for you to work in  if you like doing that sort of thing  I tried to install spark plugs once and didn t tag the spark plug wires and reinstalled them into the wrong positions  That was a rough start Dipsticks for everything  even manual transmission fluid  large funnel like caps  so it s easy to add fluids b Postscript  I taught my girlfriend at the time how to drive stick in this dear old Saab of mine  We went to school together  and after the spring semester was over  she went home to Maine  I drove my Saab up to Maine every other weekend to see her Halfway through the summer  I received a  letter  from her and it was not  good news  She announced that she had gotten a new haircut and was now a new woman  and I was history  Yup The Saab soon bankrupted me  new breaks   700  and I had to sell it  My parents had been assisting me financially for the upkeep of this car  but I felt bad that it was costing so much money  I sold the Saab to another of my father s coworkers for  500  He belonged to a Saab Club and he got the car running fine and dandy  He discovered that the fuel pump in the engine needed to be replaced  Cost   25 Damn it  ,0,My Saab b 1982 Saab 900S Number Doors 2

208,Auto, It was always my dream to own a hummer  I wanted it so bad ever since i was a kid  and recently I finally got one  It s difficult to own and maintenance  but is well worth it Features Pros Huge tires  These tires are bigger than my 7 year old son  They are huge and well worth it  Even though a set ends up costing over  500  its well worth it  When i took this beast up to the mountains  I was amazed at the stuff it could do  It was driving over 5 foot rocks like there was nothing there  This thing was driving through 4 feet of water with ease like it would on the road  It is definately a vehicle for the offroad  No wonder they use them in the army  Tough  You can t imagine how tough these things are  I smacked into a tree head on at 70 mph and there was barely a scratch on it  I mean just imagine if that was a car  Sure the other people wouldn t be lucky to hit you  but you are almost garunteed survival  With the hge tires  you d probably end up running them over like that 5 foot rock  It s just about the safest little beast you can ride  It s very intimidating to see this monterous beast driving up to you with its huge form  It has a the same width of an 18 wheeler and almost as tall  Nobody ll get in your way with this thing Fame  Whenever I go anywhere with my hummer  even just a small trip to the grocery store  there is almost always somebody there to ask about my hummer  It ll make you feel like you re a star  when somebody comes up and asks questions and says that they wish they had a hummer  If you don t like being popular  don tget a hummer  But who wouldn t love the envy of others  Surprisingly quiet  I once rode in a 1992 hummer at my uncles house as a child  and I remembered the huge car  huge tires  and huge sound  It was like driving one of those old submarines where you go deaf after two hours  The radio had to be up all the way just to hear it  But now  somehow they kept that same ominous look and feel  without that apocalyptic sound  You can take a nice quiet drive down the road at night without waking up the whole neigborhood  2 000 pund winch  There is an option to get a 2 000 pound winch and i would suggest getting it  Now you can put your hummer to work  Drag entire trees into your campsite and other things on that subject  I once tried to use my hummer for water skiiing in a small lake  I don t suggest this  But still  it s great to have it  You can do alkmost anything with the hummer if you get this Cons Gas Guzzler  As much as I wanted a hummer as a child  I did research and found out what it was really like  It gets horriblegas mileage and uses hard to find deisel  They give you a huge tank for a reason  You can hold about 45 gallons in the Primary and Auxillary tanks  so it is well eqipped to last about 500 1000 miles  It s much better on the highway because you can control the road with the fear of others and you don t have to slow down often  And in the woods its a powerhouse  but I would neer use my hummer to commute  I made a pact with myself never to own a regualar car  so I drive a Saturn VUE most places  It gets good gas mileage  but that s off the subject  Don t get the hummer as your primary vehicle  because you ll be spending hundreds on gas  Every week or so  I do take my hummer to work just to show it off  but it s just not healthy to take it every day Sluggish steering  I found it to have some slow steering to no surprise  I have gotten used to it but in the beginning  I couldn t take it anywhere  It really is a bit difficult to go most places until you get used to the way it works and it is not fun when you re waiting  But it is well worth it because once you get used to it  It s a huge  mean  fighting machine Space  It takes up a lot of space  I can t fit it in my garage  but it doesn t get dirty in the rain  And you can t park it at those parking garges with height limits most of the time  and sometimes you have to hang out of the wondow to pick up your food at the drive through  but the size pays off  If you re going to meet someone  they can t miss a huge green hummer  And it strikes fear on the hearts of millions  but the size does limit it places to go  Another reason I prefer my VUE  ,0,It always dream hummer I wanted bad ever since kid recently I finally got one It difficult maintenance well worth Features Pros Huge tire These tire bigger 7 year old son They huge well worth Even though set end costing 500 well worth When took beast mountain I amazed stuff could It driving 5 foot rock like nothing This thing driving 4 foot water ease like would road It definately vehicle offroad No wonder use army Tough You imagine tough thing I smacked tree head 70 mph barely scratch I mean imagine car Sure people lucky hit almost garunteed survival With hge tire probably end running like 5 foot rock It safest little beast ride It intimidating see monterous beast driving huge form It width 18 wheeler almost tall Nobody get way thing Fame Whenever I go anywhere hummer even small trip grocery store almost always somebody ask hummer It make feel like star somebody come asks question say wish hummer If like popular tget hummer But love envy others Surprisingly quiet I rode 1992 hummer uncle house child I remembered huge car huge tire huge sound It like driving one old submarine go deaf two hour The radio way hear But somehow kept ominous look feel without apocalyptic sound You take nice quiet drive road night without waking whole neigborhood 2 000 pund winch There option get 2 000 pound winch would suggest getting Now put hummer work Drag entire tree campsite thing subject I tried use hummer water skiiing small lake I suggest But still great You alkmost anything hummer get Cons Gas Guzzler As much I wanted hummer child I research found really like It get horriblegas mileage us hard find deisel They give huge tank reason You hold 45 gallon Primary Auxillary tank well eqipped last 500 1000 mile It much better highway control road fear others slow often And wood powerhouse I would neer use hummer commute I made pact never regualar car I drive Saturn VUE place It get good gas mileage subject Don get hummer primary vehicle spending hundred gas Every week I take hummer work show healthy take every day Sluggish steering I found slow steering surprise I gotten used beginning I take anywhere It really bit difficult go place get used way work fun waiting But well worth get used It huge mean fighting machine Space It take lot space I fit garage get dirty rain And park parking garges height limit time sometimes hang wondow pick food drive size pay If going meet someone miss huge green hummer And strike fear heart million size limit place go Another reason I prefer VUE,"[2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 15, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,

210,Camera, Don t get me wrong  the Canon Elph S200 is an awesome camera  it s super compact  it takes great photos  clear up to an 8x10  it s simple to use  it takes decent MPEGs  and it looks way cool This is the perfect camera for anyone taking simple snapshots of friends and family  I bought this before my first child was born so that I had a digital camera during labor and delivery and could send out those first pictures of the baby over the internet with a quickness  It worked out great  The pictures were very clear  even in low light  I m not sure why there are complaints on the flash quality  we had absolutely no problems in that area  Even when I couldn t see the baby on the LCD screen because the room was too dark  the flash was definitely bright enough to take a great picture I also love that it uses the Compact Flash card rather than a Smart card  Since more and more things are using a Flash card rather than the Smart Media  I am able to swap my IPAQ s card with my Elph s and always have a spare The battery life has also not been an issue for us  As you can imagine  being new parents we take tons of pictures  I typically take about ten pictures a day and maybe three movies a week  I do not charge my battery more than once a week  if that  So  in other words  the battery lasts for quite some time  I also love the fact that the battery is rechargeable  and it does quickly recharge  about an hour and a half after the first charge  because we would be going through a million batteries otherwise The camera is also sturdy and durable  I take this camera with me every where and it usually travels by diaper bag so it gets thrashed around quite a bit  It also has gotten occasionally  misted  or gotten some baby finger goop on it  but it cleans up like a champ and I have not had one problem with it working improperly or being damaged I have a few complaints about the camera   I wish the zoom was better  I know that the digital zoom can get right up close  but you lose so much resolution when you print that I never go past the 2 0 optical zoom  Usually  that s close enough  But now that my little one is walking  it is hard to get a nice  close up shot when he s across the room  There is lens adapter so no additional lenses can be attached  There is no battery life indicator  This makes it difficult to determine when the battery needs charging  until it gets too late  I wish it came with a carrying case  Canon offers a camera case specifically for the Elph  but from what I can remember  they were a bit pricey  We opted for getting a generic holder  which works great  but it would have been nice if it came with the package when we bought the camera The shutterlag can get a bit annoying  If you always push the shutter halfway down so that the camera has ample time to focus and what not  then the shutter  obviously  won t lag  But if you want to take a quick photo to capture that perfect moment  you may just miss it because the camera took too long to do its business  This is not terribly pronounced  but it does happen  The 16MB compact flash card is a joke  Considering how inexpensive flash cards have become  you would think Canon would spring for a 128 or something  I really do like this camera  it certainly serves its purpose at the moment  Eventually it will be traded in for a camera that accepts additional lenses and  of course  has more megapixels  ,1,Don get wrong Canon Elph S200 awesome camera super compact take great photo clear 8x10 simple use take decent MPEGs look way cool This perfect camera anyone taking

213,Camera, Many users like floppies because they re familiar and offer a cable free PC interface  which is uncommon in digital cameras  But floppy disks provide limited storage space and require an unacceptably long delay while an image is saved  Although the Mavica MVC FD90 writes images to floppies four times faster than PC floppy drives  it still makes you wait 10 seconds between shots  You might capture your child s first step  but you ll miss the second and third ones  You have to wait about 6 seconds for the camera to power on before you can take a shot One of the camera s biggest advantages is long battery life  and the LCD displays the minutes of charge time remaining  But you can t change the batteries while the Mavica MVC FD90 is mounted on a tripod  That s unfortunate because the camera is unwieldy and hard to position handheld for image composition with the LCD  even though the screen is large and bright  The camera s user interface is a little confusing at first  but once you ve run through the features a few times  the clearly marked controls and menus make it easy to operate br br  ,1,Many user like floppy familiar offer cable free PC interface uncommon digital camera But floppy disk provide limited storage space require unacceptably long delay image saved Although Mavica MVC FD90 writes image floppy four time faster PC floppy drive still make wait 10 second shot You might capture child first step miss second third one You wait 6 second camera power take shot One camera biggest advantage long battery life LCD display minute charge time remaining But change battery Mavica MVC FD90 mounted tripod That unfortunate camera unwieldy hard position handheld image composition LCD even though screen large bright The camera user interface little confusing first run feature time clearly marked control menu make easy operate br br,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1]",0.8516324637487712

226,Camera, Well  first off  this was my first digital camera  but I had done extensive amounts of research on them before coming to my conclusion  The main deciding factor was the price i was able to get it for off of Ebay  Well  the first thing that caught my eye  was the nice size  It is a nice travel companion  The 2 1 megapixels also helped because i knew i didnt want to go below two and have only internet worthy pics  but I wanted some power  I have taken this camera with me everywhere  and it has only failed me when i failed it  forgot to charge battery  wrong picture quality chosen  The case is amazing  I never would have thought that a company could make such a strong  metal  attractive case  and make it appealing to comsumers and professionals alike  Because most digital cameras on the market now  will be made of pure weak plastic shells  and a good strong case is a thing to look for if you want the camera to last  and this one will  With only one exception on my opinion  the jog dial  I had the camera in my pocket one day and i was on the tile floor  and i slipped and fell  Good news  no broken circuitry  bad news  the jog dial fell off  Nothing a little super glue and a fine tuned eye couldnt fix  like 6 pieces were involved  The most impressive aspects of this camera really got to shine when i was taking close ups  very good detail  night shots with flash  and black and white  very crisp images  One of the things i didnt like was the fact that there were no image settings like sepia  of negative  only black and white  A very handy feature on this little guy is the half touch focus  You push down the shutter button halfway and it auto focuses  One of the things i didnt like  was the 16 frame movie mode  It was useful on a rare occasion because it is basicaly taking 16 pictures them seaming them into one big picture  not in any movie format  just a colage  If you do take that kind of a movie  you can watch it on the camera  no sound  jerky  but not on your computer  The software features one very handy feature QuickFix  this is a one click solution to unscrewing the pictures that the camera screwed up in quality  Other than that on the software  i just use it to download the pics to the computer which is easy enough for me  You can adjust the cameras bulb speeds  which i havent found handy yet  but yet is the key word  I love the LCD display so much compared to all of the ones offered on sony models and so on  it is very crisp  bright and easy to read  The LCD leads me to the battery life  which can be greatly reduced with the use of the LCD  The battery just never seemed to pull throught when i needed it most  but hey  for what you can buy this camera for these days  you might as well get a better battery  right  Since im not a professional photographer  and I dont get paid for the pictures i take  Me and the PDR M4 are a perfect match  but hey  who says a pro could tell the difference  most can t  Over all  this camera is a great buy  the only camera that i will warn you not to buy if your life depends on it  is a sony mavica with a floppy drive  they are fat  loud  too bright  horrible picture quality  heavy  yet people and schools still buy them  don t waste your money  go for the PDR M4 it is worth every penny  ,1,Well first first digital camera I done extensive amount research coming conclusion The main deciding

232,Auto, I should clarify that I got this as a rental  I didn t ask for it  but they had already given away the standard full size car I wanted  So they  quot upgraded quot  me to the town car  I think it s called the Town Car because you could fit the population of a small town inside it  As big as it is  I thought it would be unmanuverable and slow  It s not  It accelerates quickly  but the only way I knew was to look at the speedometer  You can t feel a thing in this car  Driving a Town Car is a lot like sitting on a plush  comfy couch while playing a really good driving simulator on a computer  The seats are amazingly comfortable  and the car has less engine road noise than any vehicle I have ever seen  There is no feedback from the road and the steering is incredibly sensitive  I kept wandering in the lane because the slightest pressure on the wheel and the car changes direction  Inattention could be disasterous because the first warning that you have turned would be the crunch of the bumper b Man that s big b  Not that hitting a guardrail would harm you  The bumper is waaay at the front of the car  Outside of a heavy truck I can t think of many vehicles that would be safer than this one  Besides the normal complement of air bags  it also has a warning light that bongs  at you if the driver hasn t buckled the seat belt  If I owned this car that would be the first fuse to come out  It doesn t easily fit into parking spaces  Six people could easily ride in it and the trunk is large enough to sleep two  But it doesn t look bad  The styling is very nice  and it s a very comfortable car in all respects  Surprisingly for such a big car  it still gets about 20MPG in mixed driving  Not great  but I was expecting faster fuel consumption b How do I b Everything in this car is powered  The seat  quot remembers quot  your settings and when you stop the car it pulls back to allow you to get out easier  When you start the car it slides you to your preferred

238,Camera, Been using the Canon Digital Elph S100 Powershot after having used the Sony Mavica family of cameras as well as the Kodak DC 280 and 3400  I have to Say that the Canon S100 is by far the best  For all the same features  you get with the other cameras  you get so much more with The Canon  It s got a small form factor that really makes it so convenient to carry around  That s the huge advantage with this camera  Who wants to lug around their beastly Sony Mavica around after using this It s easy to set up  and the picture quality is fantastic  You can t beat that  My only gripes  Canon doesn t include a spare battery  the stock Compact Flash card is ONLY 8 MB  and there is no case included  Kinda cheap for a camera that is really nice The PowerShot S100 features an elegant  stainless steel  SUS316  body equipped with a number of advanced camera features including a 35 70mm  35mm equivalent  f 2 8 4 0 all glass aspherical lens to help minimize image distortion  A 4x digital converter extends the zoom range of the lens to 8x when used in conjunction with its 2x optical zoom capabilities  In addition  the camera is equipped with a three point AiAF autofocus system that permits the camera to automatically select the primary subject  even if the subject is off center  To further simplify overall operation  the Digital ELPH displays most camera settings on the LCD

266,Camera, Why did I trade in my Coolpix 950 for the 995  After owning and using the 950 for almost a year there were just a few shortcomings that irritated me to the point that I didn t enjoy using the camera anymore  So I realized that there were only a few options open to me  Either dump it in my drawer and forget about it  only to be taken out when absolutely necessary  or trade it in for one of the newer generation of digital cameras while it was still worth something What exactly were those irritating traits I hear you ask  The number one failure for me was its dismal battery life  Take a couple of pictures  scroll through your shots to decide which ones are keepers and which ones to delete  and before you know it  the screen is dead   due to a dead battery  The other main downfall for me was the way the Nikon engineers had set up the options menu concerning the self timer and close up features  viz  that you could have the one or the other  but not both  This was a big no no for me as I especially needed the timer feature while taking highly magnified close up shots of watch movements  Seeing as it s almost impossible to depress the shutter without even a tiny amount of camera movement  the timer feature would have come in handy had it been an option  Well  it  was  an option  just not one to be used simultaneously with the close up feature Fortunately a friend at work was keen on buying my 950  so now the prospect of getting the 995 was made much more affordable  The main reason that I didn t change brands  but decided to stick with the Nikon  was that I absolutely loved the incredibly sharp and bright pictures of the former  regardless of whether they were taken in the regular mode or using macro So how does the 995 stack up against its older generation sibling  Here is a brief rundown keeping in mind what my main uses of the camera are  which is for close ups of watches and watch parts and general family pictures b The Good b Picture quality is still excellent  with the added benefit of having 4X zoom versus 3X for the newer generation model   8mm to 32mm vs 7mm to 21mm  In the areas of sharpness  contrast  definition and saturation of colors  it seems to be at least as good as the 950  which had an excellent reputation for being outstanding in those areas  To be honest  I can t really tell if one is better than the other as I would need a professional quality printer to be able to give you an absolute answer  My printer  a new Canon S300   2400 X 1200 dpi   is only good enough to show me that they seem to be at least comparable  And certainly excellent enough to satisfy the most demanding users  Macro is unchanged  still an amazing 2cm is the closest focusing distance  Flash is now a pop up unit so red eye  while not entirely eliminated  is greatly reduced  The pop up style flash also has the added advantage in that it is automatically off until you deliberately pop it up  The push and rotate set up to access the different menus and options is very easy  logical and straightforward to use  And  oh yes  battery life has been greatly extended  About two hours of continuous use versus about 10 minutes for its predecessor While I wish that Nikon would put in a separate button or switch for the self timer  at least now one can use the close up feature together with it  The downside being that the self timer only operates in the close up mode which means that the auto focusing is much finer and hence slower versus the regular modes The quick review function is really handy  especially considering the delay between the time the shutter is pressed and the picture is actually taken  so one can see whether one made the shot or not  and if so whether it s a keeper or not b The Bad b No complaints from me this time about inadequate documentation  This is a company that obviously listens to their customers  The instruction booklet is complete  and for those requiring larger print  the complete manual is available on the supplied CDROM  While I was amazed at the brightness and resolution of the 950 s viewing screen  I m not too enthusiastic about the one on the 995  Not only is it a little smaller   4 7cm versus 5cm   but a lot less bright and  regardless of how I adjust the viewing options  lower resolution  especially in low light conditions  Oh well  I guess that s the price users have to pay for the greatly extended battery life  I have a sneaking suspicion that that the amazing viewing screen was the main culprit for the 950 s dismal battery life This is still not a camera for sports aficionados  due to the delay from the time the shutter is released till the time the shot is actually taken  In fact  there is still so much lag that one will probably find this camera inadequate for candid shots  especially if your children are anywhere near as active as mine  I honestly don t think that this is just a shortcoming of Nikon digital cameras in general  or this one in particular  but of all digital cameras  due to the way they work  I think that it will be a few more years before digital cameras will be able to match regular film cameras in the area of speed  When you see the sports action photographers going digital  then you ll know that they ve overcome that weakness The viewfinder is still not much to write home about  But I realize that if Nikon were to give it a true through the lens viewfinder  both the cost and size would increase dramatically This final criticism is not really a serious one  But now one has so many options that when one scrolls through the different menus some have more than one page  Read the instructions and just practice going through them to get comfortable and familiar with all of them and how to switch between them  In order to see how intuitive the camera is to use  I managed to figure them all out without reading the instruction booklet  To all of my friends and family whom I have chided in the past for not reading the instructions  I humbly apologize  As the saying goes  when all else fails  read the instructions b The Ugly b While still not an attractive camera by any means   the Canon Elph wins that award hands down   the swivel feature definitely makes the camera easier to hold firmly and minimizes its bulk while not in use  The 995 doesn t have the same metal body as the 950  so it does give the impression of being less solidly built than the latter  Although my experience has been that the polycarbonate type of plastics that the camera manufacturers use is very tough  On the plus side it does have the added advantage of reducing the cameras weight b A few important manufacturers specifications b i CCD i  28 5mm CCD capable of 3 34 million pixels i Image Size i  640X480  VGA

Rechargeable Li ion   supplied with both one battery and the charger  which doubles as an AC adaptor  Final Thoughts b Although the 995 comes with a USB cable to hook it up directly to one s comp  I still prefer to use a card reader as it frees up the camera for other uses  Coupled with the fact that I don t need to deplete the camera s battery or hook up the AC adaptor  As I mentioned in my 950 review  even although the prices of mega storage cards have fallen dramatically  I m still not a fan of them for the reasons given  I use either a 16MB or 32MB Compact Flash card  Maybe I would be more keen on them if I printed larger photos  As I don t print anything larger than 8  X 10  I don t need the higher resolution  hence no need for massive storage cards  All in all I m very happy with my purchase and even although I miss the incredible clarity of the 950 s viewing screen  I m pleased that I made the upgrade  Email me for any further questions or comments  Gary  ,1,Why I trade

continuous use versus 10 minute predecessor While I wish Nikon would put separate button switch self timer least one use close feature together The downside self timer operates close mode mean auto focusing much finer hence slower versus regular mode The quick review function really handy especially considering delay time shutter pressed picture actually taken one see whether one made shot

287,Camera,  OVERVIEW  The folks at Olympus have often been innovators in both the 35mm camera and digital imaging worlds  Their half frame Pen F cameras from the early sixties offered photographers the option of 72 images on a standard  36 exp  roll of 35mm film  with all the lenses and accessories of a true  system  camera  The Olympus OM1 of 1977 was the first of the compact full feature 35mm cameras  a system that revolutionized camera design  The Olympus OM3Ti and OM4Ti 35mm cameras are still available for fans of precision built manual focus 35mm cameras  The Olympus D300L was the first  serious  prosumer digital camera  At a time when most consumer digital cameras were toys  the D300L was a capable and competent image maker  Olympus followed the D300L with the C2500L Digital SLR  aimed right at the heart of the growing digital imaging movement  A quality digital camera that eschewed  bells   whistles in favor of solid engineering and first class image making capabilities at a price that withered the competition  The new Olympus Camedia E10 Digital SLR continues this tradition of innovation and unique solutions to imaging challenges There are only a handful of serious  PRO  level digital cameras on the market  the Nikon D1  Canon s new D30  the Fuji Finepix S1 Pro  and a couple of 35mm pro models  modified to do digital duty  from Kodak  Olympus has engineered a new camera  that it claims can compete with these top of the line  PRO  Digital SLR s  The new Olympus Camedia E10 Digital SLR  costing less than two grand  offers convincing evidence that pro features are available without the  3500 to  6000 initial investment required with all the other  PRO  model digital SLR s  The Olympus E10 accomplishes these design breakthroughs by using new approaches to solve old problems  How does the E10 do this  Most importantly  the camera doesn t offer interchangeable lenses  Instead Olympus has designed a new 9 36mm  35 140mm 35mm equivalent  f2 0 2 4 zoom lens that was engineered from its inception to mate perfectly with the Olympus four megapixel  2 3 inch  CCD sensor  This  designed from scratch  zoom lens and CCD sensor  combo  provide an extremely clean  sharp as a tack  and noise free 2240x1680 image file  CCD sensors are far less forgiving of stray and indirect light than silver based film  Olympus engineers took this fact into consideration and designed the one piece rigid body camera lens unit to capitalize on the differences between traditional silver based imaging materials and digital imaging technology  Digital sensors require a direct  straight line  path  stray light and reflections seriously degrade the quality of the final image  The E10 s new  super corrected  zoom is focused directly on the CCD  and offers exceptional resolution throughout the zoom range b CUTTING EDGE DESIGN   ENGINEERING  Olympus s new digital SLR doesn t compromise on image quality  features  performance  or  PRO  capabilities  Olympus claims that the one piece body and lens design offers better alignment between lens and CCD  improving image resolution and eliminating dust and contaminants inside the camera  Dust and particulate contaminants inside the mirror box are a real concern with the Nikon D1 and the Fuji Finepix S1 Pro  both require fairly regular  dust control  and a can of compressed air is a needed extra component  In addition Olympus has incorporated a very powerful 32 mb SDRAM to rapidly process the 4 megapixel images at rates of up to 3 FPS  for up to four frames  which works in conjunction with the proprietary Olympus  True Pic  system to optimize all captured data in  real time  before saving the data to storage media Olympus designed the new 4 megapixel  3 9 effective  CCD to enhance brightness perception  this is accomplished by using two green filters for every red and blue filter  Green significantly increases the perception of brightness  and this makes colors appear richer  brighter  and fuller  Three metering options  ESP multi pattern  centerweighted  and spot  exposure compensation  3EV  and auto bracketing help to insure consistently correct exposures The controls on the E10 are logically laid out  Olympus asked professional photographers to offer advice on the optimal operational layout of the camera  and then they followed that advice  The result is a camera that photographers will love  because it was in large part designed for photographers  by photographers  Ergonomically the E10  fits the hands well  is extremely easy to operate  the controls are intuitive  and all buttons and switches are within easy reach when holding the camera  Olympus says the camera can be operated in the dark  by touch b FEATURES  Two separate AF modes work in tandem to insure focusing precision and accuracy  Manual focus and manual zoom capabilities are especially attractive  since they will feel  right  to photographers who learned image making with manual cameras  Shooting in Aperture or Shutter Priority  or full Manual mode will allow the control  that photographers who insist on being completely in charge of their image making  insist on  White balance can be individually tailored for a wide variety of shooting conditions with seven color temperature settings  Virtually any lighting situation can be mastered by using the  One Touch  white balance adjustment  Auto  TTL  white balance produced some of the truest skin tones I have ever seen The E10 offers slots for both  Smart Media  and Compact Flash  Types I   II  cards  Depending on the capacity of the card employed  a huge number of images can be stored  This provides an obvious advantage  since the photographer can shoot quite a few images before the storage media needs to be replaced  The E10 utilizes a USB  storage class  interface for fast and easy data transfer  your computer will  recognize  the camera as an external drive b IN THE FIELD OPERATION   HANDLING  The Olympus E10 functions intuitively  as soon as you pick up the camera  your fingers instantly find the controls  The optional  Power Grip  is a highly recommended accessory  this provides a vertical shutter release  plus the four additional batteries will extend operation time significantly  I had about sixty minutes to check out the camera  as far as I know it was the first E10 in Louisville  and there were a couple of other photographers who were waiting impatiently for their turn to play with it  I was very impressed with its ease of operation  After everyone had spent a little time with the camera we were shown two 8x10 custom prints from E10 TIFF files that were the best digital images I have ever seen  they were comparable to 35mm slide prints b Technical Specifications  4

289,Camera, Hubby and I were in a Best Buy in April 2003  He was looking at computer peripherals while I wandered around browsing the displays  Then I thought to look at the digital cameras  I d been intrigued by the Mavica floppydisk concept  imagine my delight when I found they had a CD R model available  I called hubby over and we did end up buying it  The CD400 has many features which may require a little bit of instruction manual study  Luckily the manual is clear and concise  I recommend experimenting with the settings to see the results  A disc is cheap I took the camera on vacation to Southern California the first week of June  I took over 600 photos all on one disc  Boy  this beats film cameras and those  memory sticks  for other digital cameras  The bulkiness may be an issue for some people  The Mavica cameras are about the size of an SLR camera  My own opinion is that the advantages of the Mavica make its bulkiness a non issue BE CAREFUL with the viewscreen  It is an LCD screen and is easily damaged  I wish Sony made a clip on cover for it but they don t  If you have the camera strap around your neck  and there are buttons on your shirt  they may scratch or abrade the LCD screen  The number of images which you can fit on a disc will vary according to what image size you choose  and what resolution you choose  Shutter lag varies according to the type of photo you are taking  Manual settings for long exposures need a second  The camera will take a few seconds to process data from long exposures  This is normal  The Mavica MVC CD 400 uses a camcorder battery  which you charge while it is in the camera  I highly recommend one or two spare batteries  the camera will use a lot of  juice  ESPECIALLY for flash photos and movie clips Movie clips  Yes indeed  The Mavica has a built in microphone and will record a short movie clip in MP3 format  You can view the images in several ways  First  you can use the review function on the camera and see them on the viewscreen  Second  you can attach the supplied A V cable to the camera and a TV  Third  you can remove the completed disc from the camera and download the images to your computer This camera can do a

297,Camera, Anyone considering a digital camera should read the excellent reviews in epinions first  This  review  is just a footnote to those  I bought this for my daughter after buying last year s model last year for my other daughter  the A40  Both have been good  dependable cameras  Both of my teen age daughters use their camera to make photos on line and the occasional print  what many teens seem to do  We like this camera because it is big enough to hold comfortably  It feels like a camera  We got our fingers in the picture with our small camera  For us  a larger size is important  When buying a camera don t forget to budget about  100 for essential accessories  an extra compact flash card  NiMH batteries  a case  and a card reader for your computer  Think carefully about how much you will use the camera  For light use  alkaline batteries are a good choice  NiMH batteries cost at least  50 while alkalines cost about  5 00 per set and seem to last long enough  Budget for the NiMH but hold off until you find you need them  The camera works well reading directly into Canon s new printers  There are limitations to this  you can t edit much  but you can get a print quickly at home  It has been handy a few times but if you have friends over  for example  it s a great idea  The Canon printers are excellent  The quality of 4x6 prints is superb for an amateur camera  No camera in this range has a hot shoe for a heavy duty flash  something I wish this type of camera had  You need a small case when carrying the camera around  ,1,Anyone considering digital camera read excellent review epinions first This review footnote I bought daughter buying last year model last year daughter A40 Both good dependable camera Both teen age daughter use camera make photo line occasional print many teen seem We like camera big enough hold comfortably It feel like camera We got finger picture small camera For u larger size important When buying camera forget budget 100 essential accessory extra compact flash card NiMH battery case card reader computer Think carefully much use camera For light use alkaline battery good choice NiMH battery cost least 50 alkalines cost 5 00 per set seem last long enough Budget NiMH hold find need The camera work well reading directly Canon new printer There limitation edit much get print quickly home It handy time friend example great idea The Canon printer excellent The quality 4x6 print superb amateur camera No camera range hot shoe heavy duty flash something I wish type camera You need small case carrying camera around,"[3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]",0.7280457243540538
307,Auto, First off  this is a sports car  Two words  sports car  This car is  not  for someone looking for a cost effective means of transportation  This car is for the enthusiast  with the exception of the 6 cylinder model  The Mustang has dominated its car class since 1965 and still retains its position as the best sports car on the market for several reasons  It s fast  reliable  and above all  a blast to drive  The gas mileage isn t great  but when you re looking to buy a sports car gas mileage shouldn t be an issue  Its not a low humming 4 cylinder so don t expect it to use gas like one  As with purchasing any car  you have to do your homework before you jump in head first  Hopefully  this review will help you along the way  The only predominant problem with the  94 Mustang is that the Fuel Pump will go out after about 5 or 6 years of regular driving  but if you plan on buying one in the near future chances are that it has already been replaced  I have read reports of other things going bad  but for the most part these are isolated scenarios  I ve talked with enough experienced drivers and mechanics to know that the Mustang is one of the most reliable sports cars on the road today  Mine hasn t failed me yet and I know well over 15 other people that can say the same about their present and past  Stangs  Mustangs are built tough and they last  Handling isn t the best  but then again a Mustang isn t a Porsche  It s a muscle car  You ll never be able to drop the clutch in a Porsche the way you can in a Mustang  Even Camaro s  as hard as they try  will never come close to touching the feeling  sound  and experience of driving a Mustang  Every time I start my car I get excited and every time I turn it off and get out  I can t help but just stare at it  It s definitely an eye catcher  The one thing that convinced me to buy this car is its get up and go power  Just knowing that I can pass someone without even thinking about it is a good feeling  This is definitely a car that will grow on you with time  Its smooth and well defined body hides a monstrous V8 beast  It s true that this is one of the Mustang s slower years  It comes after the 235hp  93 model and 2 years prior to the introduction of the modular 4 6l V8  but don t let that fool you  note  the  94 GT has 215hp and an estimated city MPG of 17  This car is by all means a force to be reckoned with  If you re an experienced driver  driving in the rain should be no problem  If you re not an experienced driver and you re worried about driving it in the rain  just take it easy and she ll handle just fine  The one and only thing I ve found to be discomforting about this car on the interstate is that at high speeds in the rain it tends to hydroplane on and off depending on road and weather conditions  One highlight  however  is that the  94 Mustang handles much better than the preceding Foxbody Style Mustang  89 93  and hydroplanes much less as a result  Consider this car a two seater and the back seat as storage space  If you want passenger space that is comfortable  look into buying a sedan instead of a coupe  I haven t had any complaints about the back seat as of yet  but it seems to be the popular opinion that Mustang back seats are uncomfortable and cramped  I mention this only for your own good  All of the controls are placed within easy access of the driver and the electronic seat function lumbar support can make you feel like a king once you ve adjusted it properly  The interior feels more like a cockpit than anything else  Another thing I would like to touch on is the fact that the Mustang has a very high safety rating  As long as you don t wrap it around a tree  you won t be in for as much damage as you might be with other cars in the same class  I only mention this to cover all the different aspects of the  94 Mustang  I would also like to note that the car s automatic transmission is not weak  I ve seen several complaints about the transmission being weak and false rumors that the reason the Cobra doesn t come with an optional 4 speed automatic is because the transmission wouldn t be able to handle it  The Cobra doesn t have an automatic transmission because it s a Cobra and most high end sports cars are bought with a 5 speed transmission  not a clunking 4 speed automatic  My mustang is peaking 64 thousand miles and I haven t had any problems since I purchased it other than the fuel pump which I mentioned earlier  It runs smooth and still has the pony spirit that is synonymous with the Mustang name  Lastly  remember there is nothing like a Mustang and you won t be able to understand it until you ve driven one  I won t even try to put it into words because I can t  If you re looking into this car as a possible purchase in the near future  go to your local dealership and test drive one  but make sure it s a GT  I also recommend finding a 5 speed as it yields much more power than an automatic transmission will ever dream of pulling from the car s 302 cubic inch engine  ,0,First sport car Two word sport car This car someone looking cost effective mean transportation This car enthusiast exception 6 cylinder model The

308,Camera, My wife and I had been shopping for a digital camera for months  but were waiting for some extra cash before buying one  I wanted at least 3 MP and had planned on spending over  300  Well  when Wal Mart advertised a 6 hour  After Thanksgiving sale  and had this Kodak 3 2 MP camera for  154  I jumped at the opportunity  We have been very happy with this camera and the pictures that it takes  The only disadvantage is that there is no optical zoom and the digital zoom is fairly useless  However  I have overcome this problem by planning my shots better and then editing them with photo software  I recently took a second business trip to Copenhagen  Denmark and took this camera along  I had taken pictures on my first trip there with an APS camera  While my first set of pictures was OK  it could not compare to the quality from the digital camera  Plus  with a 64MB card  I could take dozens of pictures without the worry of film  With this camera  I have also learned how to extend the battery life so that it is not a factor when taking pictures all day  I shut off the  instant review  feature and the  live shot  feature  as these are big drains on the batteries  Then  I just download all of the pictures when I m done and delete or edit the bad ones While this is by no means a  professional  camera  it is very good for the average home photographer  If it can still be found at a low price  I would highly recommend it  That is  of course  unless someone wants to spend double the amount for a similar camera with an optical zoom I would also like to add that  as opposed to other reviewers  I have not had any problems with my lens cap   0  ,1,My wife I shopping digital camera month waiting extra cash buying one I wanted least 3 MP planned spending 300 Well Wal Mart advertised 6 hour After Thanksgiving sale Kodak 3 2 MP camera 154 I jumped opportunity We happy camera picture take The disadvantage optical zoom digital zoom fairly useless However I overcome problem planning shot better editing photo software I recently took second business trip Copenhagen Denmark took camera along I taken picture first trip APS camera While first set picture OK could compare quality digital camera Plus 64MB card I could take dozen picture without worry film With camera I also learned extend battery life factor taking picture day I shut instant review feature live shot feature big drain battery Then I download picture I done delete edit bad one While mean professional camera good average home photographer If still found low price I would highly recommend That course unless someone want spend double amount similar camera optical zoom I would also like add opposed reviewer I problem lens cap 0,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 14, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]",-1.371310260548971

324,Camera, I absolutely love the Panasonic Lumix digital camera  I have never in my life seen a camera produce such professional quality pictures  I have used my Lumix in just about every light condition possible  even in the rain  Its amazing clarity will leave you wanting to take more and more pictures  The Panasonic Lumix DMC LC40 is an amazing little piece of equipment  It offers a 3 0 mega pixel picture quality and even a 30 second video capture capability with sound  The best thing about digital cameras is that you no longer need to purchase film  A small memory stick will do the trick  The Lumix comes supplied with an 8 megabyte memory stick which is capable of holding up to 45 pictures  You can purchase higher megabyte cards to hold even more pictures  The Lumix has an LCD screen on the back so that you may view your picture as soon as you take it  If you don t like it  you can just delete it With the Lumix LCD screen you get an on screen menu full of options  You can delete one or all of your pictures from your memory stick  you can protect your pictures so they don t become deleted  You can even set up a slide show with or without the use of audio and change the duration of each slide from 1 to 5 seconds each  Lumix lets you add an audio dub to your pictures and even lets you resize  trip or format them right there on your camera  You can set your Lumix to take the best quality pictures by changing the environmental option  Such as indoors  or out  Taking pictures at sporting events  up close pictures of nature  taking pictures of family and friends to eliminate red eye  and even taking pictures when the exterior light is not just right  There is so much you can do with this Panasonic Lumix  The possibilities are endless  Such as with the 3 times zoom  you can get up close and personal with your subject  Although I feel that when zooming in from far away the Lumix zoom power is lacking  When purchasing the Lumix  you get the camera itself which also has the lens changing capabilities for when you want a larger zoom  You get a USB adapter cable to connect to your computer  You also get a CDROM from Panasonic that offers a picture placement and organization program and of course you get the instruction manual available in many different languages  All in all  this is an excellent camera  I am a firm believer that when it comes to digital cameras that you get what you pay for  The Lumix is worth every bit of it I purchased my Lumix from my local Military BX for U S 459 00 but I believe you can order these on line plus newer versions from panasonic com  Also for first hand views of what this camera can do   not sure if I can do this  but check out my personal website which is listed on my member profile  Promise  no

know EVERYTHING about this car  but for the 300 some odd miles I ve driven this car there has been alot of valuable things that I have learned  and right here is where i would like to share them with you I was 13 when my mom went to a Toyota dealer and bought this off the lot  Little did she know that 3 years later her  little boy  would be driving around in the same car by himself  yes I know its hard for me to even believe just yet  I m not exactly sure how much she spent for it  I would guess maybe around 12 14 000  If it is important to this review i will ask her myself So where shall we start  Interior Exterior Interior Exterior OK OK lets go with the Interior Interior Not too much to say  everything basic  pwr everything  overdrive  A C  rear defrost  There is also a Digital Odometer and Daytime Running Lights  something i haven t seen in other cars so this is maybe what separates it from those other cars  This car provides a good amount of room  unless you are a professional wrestler or Shaq  you probably will not be fitting into this car  Room in the back is good  Room in the front however in the drivers side is a little different  I m pushing 6 1 and I have the seat all the way back  and the steering wheel moved all the way up  All these efforts still do not eliminate the problem of my left knee hitting the steering wheel  Trunk space is quite good  I recall fitting 3 golf bags into the back  so if thats how you rate your trunk space then you re set  The system will not attract any attention really  Yeah if you turn it up 80  you ll get some bumping out of it  but I m not very impressed  Putting some subs in the back will easily eliminate this problem The Exterior I m going to keep this short and simple  since it s late and I want to go to bed  This car will in NO WAY turn heads  It is a simple 4 door design  nothing really seems to be too special about it  Anything else you want to know about the exterior  Too bad because there isn t anything else to know  If you spend maybe 2 thousand for some ground effects  put a spoiler on there  then we can talk Under The Hood Not much can be said about it  It s an l 4 basic for this type of car  It has a 1 8L engine  like I said  basic for this kind of car  This can make the car pretty weak  I drive up the same uphill road every day  and every day im having to push the car just so i can maintain a steady 65 70MPH highway speed  I find the acceleration to be all right  me being a person who loves to pour out of a turn coming off a red light  I can find that I can get up to 40 pretty quickly  and i find myself saying  Hey  that Ferrari 360 Spyder was just behind me so where did it go  Thats when my dreams get shattered and he s actually 3 miles ahead of me already  But hey  the pickup trucks and those Honda s eat dust  The Corolla redlines at 6000  so you can eliminate the drag racing up at race wars in the desert  The 4 cylinder smaller engine will make things better for you  If you hate gas guzzlers  then you know right now you ll be a bigger fan of this car  Taking the thing to the Mobil station for the first time  putting only 10 bucks in the tank and filling it up completely felt good  And if you liked that  you ll like the 30  MPG that this car gets The Ride It provides a really smooth ride  I haven t really found anything wrong with the ride yet  but if I do  you know that I ll keep you informed     The brakes seem a little bit weak compared to my dad s Mitsubishi Galant or my stepdad s BMW 5 series  It s no huge problem to worry about  but when I go from driving the Galant to driving the Corolla  I can tell there is somewhat of a difference  Nothing wrong with the handling  Front engine Front wheel drive  with new snow tires  I find minimal problems with the handling in the winter  Minimal problems means the few times you ll slide on the ice when taking a turn  I had the misfortune of taking my road test in the biggest snowstorm all year  but I had no problems with anything  Handling in regular weather is the same as it is for any car that I have driven  Nothing horrible  but nothing great enough that I can tell how great it is This car will not turn heads  Unless you have a half naked woman in the car or you have a 16 year old just getting his license who wants to drive and have his freedom  I do not think you will see a guy stepping into this car  If you want a car you can drive down the street and people look at you with the thought in their head of  Wow that guy is lucky  then buy a new red Trans Am  preferably with Ram Air and a black racing stripe with tinted windows and 2  12 subs in the trunk  my dream car  But if you are looking for a car just to get from Point A to Point B  then you might want to definitely take the Corolla into consideration  And the reliability speaks for itself  YOU put in the work the YOU will have a long lasting car  And yes we all know about Toyota s reputation for that very long lasting car  If these are the few things you want in a car  then now you know what to buy P S  I had the TV going while I was typing this up  call it a coincidence  but right when I finished this

370,Camera, I bought the Epson 3000z after comparing its  features to other 3 3 megapixel cameras  Compared to the Olympus 3030  I preferred the 3000z s use of compact flash  Compared to the Sony DSC S70  I preferred the 3000z s use of compact flash  smartmedia I might consider  but I can t think of a good excuse for memory sticks  and ergonomics  I wanted a 3x zoom  so the Canon S 20 was out  The Nikon Coolpix 990 also closely fit my specs  but I found with an earlier Nikon 900 that battery life was a big issue and that the twist body doesn t suit me  so I thought I d try another brand My experience so far with the 3000z has been mixed  The camera can take very good pictures  The lens is fast and sharp  A tiff mode is available  Battery life is very good  On the other hand  the shutter button does not give good tactile feedback  which makes pre focusing an adventure  I haven t quite gotten to the bottom of the problem  but in some modes focusing is error prone  leading to a number of blurry  throw away pictures  Also  the highest quality setting for jpegs results in files of only about 1 meg or less  Apparent quality is fine  but I would prefer to be able to save a larger  less lossy jpeg  Tiffs are available  but a real problem because they tie up the camera for about 20 seconds while saving At the time I bought the camera  I also purchased a Canon EOS 3  one of Canon s best prosumer 35mm bodies  which I find to be an interesting contrast  The price is not that far apart  I took both on a trip recently  The EOS 3 has many more options available to set parameters around a photograph  and much more sophisticated metering and focusing systems  It has a teriffic viewfinder  When you press the shutter it really conveys the sense that you have just taken a good picture  In contrast  the 3000z is smaller and more convenient  but it seems like a toy by comparison   or more accurately like a cheap point and shoot camera On my return I had the film developed  and it was pretty clear that I was more successful taking the pictures I wanted to take with the EOS 3  But the development and print process introduces variables  and my preferred output device normally is a computer screen  so after development I use a film scanner to scan the best pictures  This takes time and introduces more variables  What the 3000z has going for it is immediate accessibility in digital form and generally accurate color balance which requires little correction My overall verdict on the 3000z is that it is a frustrating product  and frustratingly close to being good  Simple usability problems prevent the camera from being satisfactory  but it can produce good results with a little luck  I m still a strong believer in digital photography  We re just not there yet with the 3000z     ,1,I bought Epson 3000z comparing feature 3 3 megapixel camera Compared Olympus 3030 I preferred 3000z use compact flash Compared Sony DSC S70 I preferred 3000z use

371,Camera, About a year ago  I purchased a 775 from Dell  900 pictures later  I m happy with the money I spent on this camera  310 after price matching The biggest advantage to this camera is its size  Sure  there are many cameras out there that will provide superior picture quality and have setting adjustments that will appease the most advanced of photographers  but with most of those cameras  you have to think twice before you bring it with you  I ve captured many great moments with this camera because I didn t have to think twice  It fits in your pocket with ease and you ll soon forget that it s even there  It s made out of plastic  so it looks almost like a toy  but it s well made and very sturdy  I dropped it once and it still works fine  The picture quality is good  not great  Colors are represented well  but not as vibrant as some of the other digital cameras that I ve seen  The pictures do come out a little soft  but this can be corrected by using the sharpening function in Photoshop  I ve printed many 4x6 pictures from the camera  and most of the pictures look quite nice  haven t tried 8x10 yet  The downside of this camera is it s slow startup time  It takes a good 10 seconds for the camera to be ready to go  Picture to picture downtime is less  but probably still slow overall  I think the slowness might be due to the memory card I m using because I remember the camera being faster when I still had the 8 MB card that it came with  Once you get used to it  the slowness of the camera is not a major concern  You just have to think ahead a little before you take a picture If all your picture taking consists of point and shoot pictures  then the 775 is a great option  Even if you are a professional photographer  I think you will still find some use for it because of it s portability  You ll take pictures that you never would have taken before because you ll have this camera there for those unexpected moments  ,1,About year ago I purchased 775 Dell 900 picture later I happy money I spent camera 310 price matching The biggest advantage camera size Sure many camera provide superior picture quality setting adjustment appease advanced photographer camera think twice bring I captured many great moment camera I think twice It fit pocket ease soon forget even It made plastic look almost like toy well made sturdy I dropped still work fine The picture quality good great Colors represented well vibrant digital camera I seen The picture come little soft corrected using sharpening function Photoshop I printed many 4x6 picture camera picture look quite nice tried 8x10 yet The downside camera slow startup time It take good 10 second camera ready go Picture picture downtime le probably still slow overall I think slowness might due memory card I using I remember camera faster I still 8 MB card came Once get used slowness camera major concern You think ahead little take picture If picture taking consists point shoot picture 775 great option Even professional photographer I think still find use portability You take picture never would taken camera unexpected moment,"[1, 1, 1, 3, 13, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 12, 1, 1, 2, 1, 11, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",-0.7415131705079214

382,Auto, In late 2000  when my 1989 Toyota Celica started to die  I began the search for my new car  My prerequisites  Compact car  good ride  good warranty  and overall value  We had recently splurged on a 2000 Toyota Camry  and while we love that car  I was not willing to spend Camry type money on a car that would be my workhorse in commutes ind business trips  I also wanted a car that looked nice  and had some good bells and whistles  like power everything  cruise control  and a CD player  While I love Toyotas  I knew that those extra bells and whistles would cost too much Then along came the Hyundai  The reviews on the 2001 Hyundai Elantra were quite remarkable  with most reviewers saying that it was better than the Toyota Corolla  my first choice  The 2001 Elantra was newly redesigned  and the warranty could not be surpassed I was skeptical  until I took the car for a test drive  It took corners better than my Celica had  and its shocks   instead of struts   made for a smooth ride over bumpy terrain When it came time to negotiate  I was able to purchase the car for less than invoice  with the help of edmunds com  Edmunds showed me the rebates available on the car  including a  500 manufacturer rebate at the time I was looking to buy  Armed with the invoice price of every piece of optional equipment I sought to include on the car  the dealer soon agreed to my asking price  In this economy  the car buyer is king Real world driving of the Elantra is even better than the test drive  It is a very quiet car  even at high speeds  Acceleration is decent for an automatic  but it is my understanding that the car is even better as a 5 speed  The climate control on the air conditioner is good  maybe even a little too cold for my tastes at times  There is plenty of leg room in front and back  comfortably seating four tall men  The stereo system is good  and the optional CD player is a nice addition  While the cruise control is difficult to figure out  without reading the manual  it is easy to program while driving My only two critiques of the car are the front seats and the trunk  The front seats are narrower than other foreign cars  and the seatbelt is positioned irregularly  making it difficult to fasten while driving  which  of course  you shouldn t do anyway  My ample hips fit snugly in the bucket seats up front  but not uncomfortably The trunk is a little too narrow  and the trunk cover is made of cheap materials  This is surprising on a car which is very well made otherwise All in all  this is a great car  It is also a great looking car  which adds to its appeal  Although the resale value of it is questionable  for anyone looking to own a car for the long haul  it s a great deal  ,0,In late 2000 1989 Toyota Celica started die I began

386,Camera, Here is my update I promised you  referring to my initial review titled  First Impression Wow  While reading this review keep in mind my saga with digital cameras  which started around Christmas time  Here is a quick refresher  With a new baby in the family I thought it would be nice to get mom a digital camera for Christmas  Not knowing much about digital cameras I spent 2 weeks going from store to store getting sales reps  opinions on cameras  The first camera I settled on was the 2 3 mega pixel Toshiba PDR M60  see my review on the Toshiba PDR M60  The Toshiba took excellent pictures but the camera casing felt cheap  Basically giving you the  I m gonna break when the warranty is up feeling  The Toshiba also used AA batteries which when taking pictures on high resolution lasts about 50 60 pics  even less with the screen on  I then traded the Toshiba in for a 1 3 mega pixel Sony DSC S30  The S30 came with a rechargeable battery and had a durable case  Overall I liked the S30 but the pictures  especially in doors and in low light  were not as crisps and clear as the Toshiba  In hopes of gaining better picture quality  plus the ability to take minute long videos  I returned the S30 and ordered the S50 from an online retailer  but that is another story all together  After my first weekend with the S50 I was impressed and left my first review titles  First Impression Wow  This is an update on that review The Sony DSC S50 is a great all around camera  Keep in mind the Toshiba and the Sony DSC S30 both cost  400  However the DSC S50 costs around  600  As far as durability and features you can not go wrong with the Sony  The rechargeable battery is the best  It really does last  I have taken almost 200 pics and 15 videos and still have 100 minutes of battery life left  The battery even recharges while still in the camera  While others have complained about Sony s flip screen monitor and the lack of a viewfinder  claiming that in bright conditions the screen is hard to see  I have not run into this yet and we have had some really sunny days in Florida  I also like how the buttons on the back of the camera are laid out  They allow for easy access while taking pictures or videos  The camera comes with plenty of features  too many to list  However the ability to record 1 minute long videos is great  While they are not the best quality they are perfect for email  Grandma cried when she saw her granddaughter eat cereal for the first time in a video I was able to send within minutes of the actual event  I do have one low point to the camera  We buy cameras to take pictures and the Sony S50 takes good pictures  However they are not excellent  If only the Sony S50 had the optics the Toshiba PDR M60 has  The S50 takes the same quality image as the S30  Simply put if you are looking for excellent quality images with clear resolution and bright vivid colors SAVE  200 and buy the Toshiba PDR M60  If the Toshiba had a better case or a rechargeable battery I would still own it  However is you are a gadget person who loves toys the DSC S50 is the camera for you  ,1,Here update I promised referring initial review titled

395,Camera, This was my first digital camera  purchased in August 1999  it hooked me on the digital camera concept  but not on this camera in particular This model is easy to use  Point and click  On board review is nice  and you can delete photos right at the camera if the shot is no good  The memory that comes with the camera holds 64 photos easily that are good enough for viewing in the internet  or about 8 high quality prints  Some fun features include built in frames and date printing The downfall of this camera is the print resolution  You can t even print even the better quality photos at bigger than 4 by 6 inches  I upload a lot of my pictures to ofoto com to have real prints made of them  and the biggest you can get uploads to come out clear there is 3 by 5 from this camera Connection is slow and I had trouble with the camera disconnecting after a certain number of transferred pictures  The Adobe software that accompanies the camera is easy to learn  but takes up quite a bit of drive space while in use   don t plan on playing a game in the background while you are cropping and editing pictures  A card reader  sold for about  30 seperately  is a smart investment  makes for faster upload This is a good starter camera  very easy to use  My six year old son took good pictures with this model  I put about 1000 pictures on this camera  it keeps count of how many times the camera has been used  mostly for things I sell on ebay  and this camera is perfect for that  Camera is sturdy  I dropped it a few times  oops  on tile floor and the worst thing that ever happened was the batteries popped out Get recharging batteries  this camera eats them in about 60 pictures   takes 4 AA br br  ,1,This first digital camera purchased August 1999 hooked digital camera concept camera particular This model easy use Point click On board review nice delete photo right camera shot good The memory come camera hold 64 photo easily good enough viewing internet 8 high quality print Some fun feature include built frame date printing The downfall camera print resolution You even print even better quality photo bigger 4 6 inch I upload lot picture ofoto com real print made biggest get uploads come clear 3 5 camera Connection slow I trouble camera disconnecting certain number transferred picture The Adobe software accompanies camera easy learn take quite bit drive space use plan playing game background cropping editing picture A card reader sold 30 seperately smart investment make faster upload This good starter camera easy use My six year old son took good picture model I put 1000 picture camera keep count many time camera used mostly thing I sell ebay camera perfect Camera sturdy I dropped time oops tile floor worst thing ever happened battery popped Get recharging battery camera eats 60 picture take 4 AA br br,"[1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 14, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]",-0.8280989352998614
396,Camera, This is my first digital camera What sold me was the features  I liked the fact that the camera uses regular AA batteries  not a pricey proprietary battery like some cameras do  So in a pinch you can find batteries anywhere You can buy rechargeable nickel metal hydride  DON T use NiCads  batteries and a charger inexpensively at Radio Shack  I also like the fact the camera uses Compact Flash memory cards  Again  widely available  This camera can use up to a 128 meg card Some cameras only have internal memory  which means when you fill up the memory  you can t take any more pictures until you download them to your computer and erase them from the camera s memory It also has a 3X optical zoom  A digital only zoom basically just crops the picture  so the resolution suffers  The camera also has a lot of settings that can be defined by the user  Flash  white balance  power settings  etc  It s got a lot of options but better have your manual handy until you get familiar with them all It also comes with a USB cable so you can download the photos to your computer  And the Canon software is pretty decent  I thought that a 1 3 megapixel camera would not produce quality photos  but I was pleasantly surprised  At the highest resolution setting  this camera takes excellent  sharp pictures  A friend of mine recently enlarged several of my shots to 8x10  and printed them out on his printer at work on photo paper The results were amazing I had always read that you couldn t enlarge pictures taken with a 1 3 megapixel camera beyond 4x6  and even that was stretching it Don t believe it The 8x10 s he made were sharper than the 4x6 prints I usually get using 400 ASA film This camera will take pictures in near total darkness  but shots taken in poor light will tend to be somewhat grainy However  the quality of pictures taken in decent light is impressive  The results are crisp  clear  well exposed and have nicely saturated colors  The battery life is about average  and there is a fair amount of parallax error when you are using the viewfinder instead of the LCD  The LCD can be hard to see in bright light  also If you are looking for your first digital camera  you absolutely cannot go wrong with one of these  It s loaded with features and won t cost an arm and a leg Canon has discontinued this model  and they can be had cheap  if you can find one I love this camera  ,1,This first digital camera What sold feature I liked fact camera us regular AA battery pricey proprietary battery like camera So pinch find battery anywhere You buy rechargeable nickel metal hydride DON T use NiCads battery charger inexpensively Radio Shack I also like fact camera us Compact Flash memory card Again widely available This camera use 128 meg card Some camera internal memory mean fill memory take picture download computer erase camera memory It also 3X optical zoom A digital zoom basically crop picture resolution suffers The camera also lot setting defined user Flash white balance power setting etc It got lot option better manual handy get familiar It also come USB cable download photo computer And Canon software pretty decent I thought 1 3 megapixel camera would produce quality photo I pleasantly surprised At highest resolution setting camera take excellent sharp picture A friend mine recently enlarged several shot 8x10 printed printer work photo paper The result amazing I always read enlarge picture taken 1 3 megapixel camera beyond 4x6 even stretching Don believe The 8x10 made sharper 4x6 print I usually get using 400 ASA film This camera take picture near total darkness shot taken poor light tend somewhat grainy However quality picture taken decent light impressive The result crisp clear well exposed nicely saturated color The battery life average fair amount parallax error using viewfinder instead LCD The LCD hard see bright light also If looking first digital camera absolutely go wrong one It loaded feature cost arm leg Canon discontinued model cheap find one I love camera,"[2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 14, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2]",1.333001982689598
397,Camera, First off  the picture associated with this camera on epinions com is not a picture of the Vivitar 3745  For an actual picture of the 3745  go to vivitar com  I researched this camera and couldn t find any reviews  but it had all of the options that I was looking for so I figured that for the price  it would be a good deal   I was wrong  I purchased this camera on walmart com  For  229 I got both the Vivitar 3745  a 3 1 mega pixel camera  and a free 128 MB SD card  Delivery was cheap and fast   I ordered on a Thursday night and received it the following Tuesday morning  The cost of 2 day shipping was less than  5  This was my first digital camera and I was looking for something to supplement my 5 year old automatic Canon 35mm camera  I m not a photography expert  so I just wanted something that was simple to use and took pictures that would be somewhat comparable to my Canon 35mm   For the last 4 years I have been paying to have all of my 35mm pictures put on disks when I get them developed  My goal with going to a digital camera was to save money on developing by putting the pictures on a disk myself and only having the best pictures printed Included in the package were digital photo editing software  the camera  a camera case  a lens cap  a wrist strap  a cord to connect the camera to your PC via a USB port  a cord to connect the camera to your TV via a RCA connection  and 4 AA alkaline batteries  The 128 MB SD Card  which I believe was a walmart com exclusive deal  shipped separately  but arrived on the same day When you first turn on the camera  you have to enter the date and time  which was easy to do  but unfortunately  this had to be done every time that you changed the batteries  and I had to change the batteries often  The menus on the camera were easy to use and I liked the fact that in addition to the picture preview LCD screen on the back of the camera  the top of the camera had a small screen which displayed the image resolution  the number of remaining pictures that could be taken at that resolution  and the remaining battery life  If the indicator was correct  you could take around 140 pictures at the highest quality resolution on a 128 MB card  In addition to taking still photos  the camera also allows you to take video without sound in the Quicktime format  a 128 MB SD card will hold about five and a half minutes worth of video  I  owned  this camera for a week and took about 150 different still pictures in various settings  inside  outside  and in various lighting  and about 12 different short videos  All of the still pictures  regardless of the lighting  were dark and pixelated looking  The videos were somewhat pixelated  but they seemed to be of better quality than the still pictures   I expected a degree of pixelization on the videos  After all  this is a still camera and the ability to shoot video is a nice bonus  but not the real purpose of the camera  When my first few pictures came out somewhat pixelated  I thought that maybe I was using the wrong image resolution setting  but that wasn 146t the case and no matter which image resolution setting I used  my pictures were dark and pixelated  The camera 146s built in flash didn t seem to make any difference in the picture quality  I took a number of pictures at night in my living room  a room that is around 15 X 20 feet  Regardless of whether the flash was used or not  my pictures were dark and pixelated  I thought that maybe the pictures would be better once I downloaded them onto my PC  I hooked the camera up to my PC via a USB port  Downloading pictures from the camera to the PC was quick and didn t require any special software  my operating system is Windows ME  But the picture quality only appeared worse on my PC  The included photo editing software was adequate  very similar to most of the other photo editing software out there  but nothing to get excited about  I tried editing and improving my photos using the included software  Microsoft Picture It  and Kodak Easyshare  No matter which program I used  my pictures were dark and pixelated and nothing seemed to improve them  Hooking the camera up to my 32 inch TV 146s RCA connector in order to view pictures on the TV was easy to accomplish  but something seemed to cause interference and in addition to being dark and pixelated  the pictures when viewed on the TV also looked  147fuzzy 148 and would fade in and out The 4 AA alkaline batteries that came with the camera lasted about 20 pictures  I changed to rechargeable Ni MH batteries and could take about 30 pictures prior to having to change batteries  and thus having to re enter the date and time with each battery change  The shutter button was very unresponsive at times  I sometimes had trouble knowing whether or not I had taken a picture and had to stop and use the review function in order to see if I had gotten the shot  When taking video  you use the shutter button to start and stop the video  but sometimes I had to push the button 5 or 6 times before I could get it to start or stop the video  Other times the camera would lock up when switching between video and still picture modes and the only way I could get the camera to work again was to take out the batteries  and then I had to re enter the date and time  After a week I had had enough and took the camera back to my local Wal Mart  I was out the shipping cost  less than  5  but I learned an important lesson about buying a cheap camera  you usually get what you pay for  This time I bought a Kodak 6340 for  279 and so far  I couldn t be happier with it  The sad thing about the Vivitar 3745 is that I really liked the layout of the camera  The functions were very intuitive  Less than a minute after taking it out of the box  I was taking pictures and I quickly figured out the majority of the functions before opening the manual latter that night  Unfortunately  all of the pictures that I took using the Vivitar 3745 weren t very good and nothing I did seemed to improve their quality  I had to sit down and read the instruction manual before I felt comfortable using my new Kodak 6340  which only took about half an hour to read cover to cover  The Kodak doesn t have as many manual settings as the Vivitar  but every picture that I ve taken with it so far is excellent and I ve already taken about 100 still pictures and a half dozen short videos  with sound  on the original set of batteries    ,1,First picture associated camera epinions com picture Vivitar 3745 For actual picture 3745 go vivitar

404,Camera, This is the first digital camera I ve owned  I ve briefly used friends  in the past and learned how wonderful these things are  So this year I finally got one as a present  Nonetheless  I m not exactly an electronic guru  I just know the simple facts  as an average user b POWER b  So I get an awesome digital camera as a gift  and what do I do  Take it out of the box and begin snapping away  No  The Sony DSC 171 uses 2 AA rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride batteries  which are included  with a recharger  And it takes up to 13 hours to charge them  NOTE  The manual specifies that the Sony DSC 171 cannot be used with regular AA alkaline batteries  So unless you also bought the AC adapter  or happen to have some fully charged Nickel Metal Hydride AA batteries handy  you have to wait about 13 hours while the batteries charge before you can use your camera  But I do like the fact that the camera comes with a recharger  The camera can also be used with an AC power adapter  but that is not included and must be purchased separately  The manual suggests that you use the AC adapter when downloading your photos or printing them  so the camera does not shut off in the middle of the process   FYI  I didn t get one  And when the camera runs out of batteries  it shuts off without retracting and closing the lens   and you can t retract or close the lens until you replace the batteries  So be sure to turn your camera off as soon as you get the low battery warning  or else you could be stuck with your lens open and sticking out  which can be inconvenient   MEMORY    The pictures you take are stored on a teeny little thing called a Memory Stick  which is shorter than a stick of gum  The camera comes with a 16mb Memory Stick  which stores about  96 of 640x480 pictures 16 of 1600x1200 pictures 10 of 2048x1536 pictures  Not a comprehensive list  but just to give you an idea   I eventually bought another Memory Stick  128mb  which cost about  80 00   LOOKING AT YOUR PICTURES    To get the pictures from your camera onto your computer  so you can e mail or print them  you can use the Video Out port and the included USB cable  Before you do this  you need to install a USB driver  which is on the enclosed CD ROM   This is quite easy  and should take just a few minutes   If you have a Sony computer  you can also just remove the Memory Stick and pop it right into your computer  You can also look at your pictures on a television with the included RCA video cable  Instant slide show of your vacation pictures anywhere there is a television   PICTURE QUALITY    The Sony DSC 171 has a resolution of 3 2 Megapixels  I m not sure exactly what this means  but it appears that the more Megapixels you have  the better your picture quality  Without much experience with other digital cameras  all I can say is that my pictures look really great  When I print them on photo paper using my ink jet printer  they look almost as good as a 35mm print to me   great colors and crisp images  I did have a chance to compare my Sony photos with the photos I took with the Polaroid PDC 640  which has less than 1 Megapixel   and what a world of difference   ZOOM    The Sony DSC 171 has an Optical Zoom of 3X and and Digital Zoom of 2X  for total zoom power of 6X  I think the 160mm zoom on my 35mm camera was a little more powerful  but the 6X zoom on the Sony DSC 171 is just fine for what I need   DESIGN   EASE OF USE    The camera is a good  compact size  and fits nicely in my hand  And all the controls  like the Mode Dial  the Control Button  and the Zoom Button  are well placed and comfortable to use  I also had no trouble with the menu  or the other functions of the Sony DSC 171  After just a few minutes with the manual  it was easy to figure out how to do everything I wanted  I was able to begin using the camera right away  once the batteries were charged  that is  So this camera is easy to use  even for a newbie like me   MOVIE    I was surprised to discover that you can record little movies with the Sony DSC 171  which you can download as MPEG files onto your computer  There is no sound  and the picture quality isn t great  so it s hardly a substitute for a camcorder  and nothing more than a fun little gimmick  But it s handy if you ever want to send a little digital footage via e mail   MISC    Aside from the initial cost of the camera  I expect that most people will want to invest in some accessories to enhance their use of the camera  Memory Stick  128mb    about  80 90 each Extra Ni MH batteries   about  6 8 for a package of 2 Case  Model LCS CP2    about  20 from sonystyle com AC adapter   about  40 from sonystyle com All in all  I m really happy with the Sony DSC 171  This will be a great  convenient way to keep and share

408,Auto, I recently purchased a 2000 ML430 brand new from the local dealer  I had a second hand  89 260E that I wanted to trade in for a truck  Having been around Mercedes for quite a while  I opted for the ML 430  I have  and still do  owned several Mercedes Benz automobiles over the past 13 years including an  87 300E   88 560SEL   97 SL500   97 S500 I have owned the ML430 for about 2 weeks now and unfortunately it has spent 8 days in service  The SRS light turned and stayed on during day number 3  I brought in the truck 1st thing Monday morning  Later that afternoon  my serviceman called saying they would have to order a new computer module  I didn t get the car back until Friday that week  Later that Friday afternoon  the SRS light turned on again and wouldn t go off  This week  I brought back the ML for repair again  Today  Wednesday  my serviceman has replaced all the airbags thinking that was the problem  but the light is still on and they can t figure it out  Now  my serviceman says he will be bringing in the Regional Service Manager to help out and the Shop Foreman who has been out of town  If they can t figure it out  my serviceman says he ll probably have to replace the truck  Again  I have owned several Mercedes Benzes that have been mostly reliable with only minor problems occurring now and then  This is a nightmare so far  Unfortunately  these ML s are unlike previous Benzes in one respect  They re made in the good old U S  of A  I suspect that American quality control is not nearly as good as the German control  For example  my  87 300E has 120 000 miles on it and never has had electronic problems such as this  Sure  the air conditioning on the 300 needed some repair and the transmission was replaced at 100 000 miles  but no other major problems that Mercedes couldn t figure out On the good side  this ML drives very well and has plenty of power  It handles quite well for a truck  Much better than any domestic truck I have driven  i e  Suburban  Denali  It s not too big  but big enough for daily tasks and occassional off roading  We drove through some gravel roads in the mountains at 60 mph and it felt solid as a rock  All in all  with my limited  but eye opening experience it drives like a Mercedes  but certainly is not reliable  If this SRS problem is indicative of what the future of this truck may be like  I might just have to apply my State s Lemon Law and ask for my money back br br  ,0,I recently purchased 2000 ML430 brand new local dealer I second hand 89 260E I wanted trade truck Having around Mercedes quite I opted ML 430 I still owned several Mercedes Benz automobile past 13 year including 87 300E 88 560SEL 97 SL500 97 S500 I owned ML430 2 week unfortunately spent 8 day service The SRS light turned stayed day number 3 I brought truck 1st thing Monday morning Later afternoon serviceman called saying would order new computer module I get car back Friday week Later Friday afternoon SRS light turned go This week I brought back ML repair Today Wednesday serviceman replaced airbags thinking problem light still figure Now serviceman say bringing Regional Service Manager help Shop Foreman town If figure serviceman say probably replace truck Again I owned several Mercedes Benzes mostly reliable minor problem occurring This nightmare far Unfortunately ML unlike previous Benzes one respect They made good old U S A I suspect American quality control nearly good German control For example 87 300E 120 000 mile never electronic problem Sure air conditioning 300 needed repair transmission replaced 100 000 mile major problem Mercedes figure On good side ML drive well plenty power It handle quite well truck Much better domestic truck I driven e Suburban Denali It big big enough daily task occassional roading We drove gravel road mountain 60 mph felt solid rock All limited eye opening experience drive like Mercedes certainly reliable If SRS problem indicative future truck may like I might apply State Lemon Law ask money back br br,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 2, 2, 13, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]",-0.6211627814214343
410,Camera, I ve been using this camera for an year and hence my comments are not from the first look  but from usage of several months If you are looking for a camera which has the best dollar per pixel value  then this is the winner But  if you are looking for convenience  durability  good quality pictures for all light conditions  keep away from this Takes good pictures in daylight  but one has to work hard to get a non shaken picture in poor light conditions Battery life is about average  The good part is that it runs on regular AA batteries  so you can get them anywhere  But  the bad part is that you have to carry lots of them with you when you go on a trip  I am not sure if this has a charger inside  but the camera did not come with any AC adapter  There is a  DC in  socket on the camera  which means there would be an optional AC adapter from KODAK to use with this camera for an extra price  but I am not sure if that can charge the batteries  if we use rechargeable AA batteries The size of the camera is big for its features  Come on  Kodak designers  what were you thinking  Digital cameras don t need a film compartment  a motor to advance rewind the film  All they need is circuitry to record data onto a memory card  an LCD screen  and a flash and that s it  The size could be much smaller on this  With the camera being light weight and big in size  you get a plastic hollow feeling when you carry this camera  Even with this big size of the camera  the battery compartment is very tight  It is barely bigger than the size of the batteries  As a result  the tension on the spring is very high causing an overload on the small plastic cover that holds the batteries  My battery compartment broke with first month of its use  I now use duck tape to cover my compartment  I am not alone in this area  My brother who has the same camera has broken battery compartment too Camera features are very well decided in the design  Cut down all the non sense and give only required to an average user  Can take pictures in two different resolution settings on to in built memory or to an external compact flash memory  I used an 64MB external memory to take more than 300 pictures during one of my vacation on this camera  It takes little while to record the picture after you release the shutter  But I think it has more to do with the speed of the memory than the camera itself  I used a cheaper memory and hence it might be of less speed  It has an in built flash  not very powerful but of average power The interface software which downloads the pictures into your PC was simple to use and easy to understand  It has some bugs though  In my Windows XP  I cannot download to the same folder all the time  I have to let it create a new folder everytime I download pictures I would have liked a USB interface or a firewire interface  Serial port is too slow  I had to wait for considerable amount of time  before the pictures are downloaded to my PC It does not an optical zoom  eliminating the need of a motor here and another question on why that big size  It has a video out  cable has to be purchased extra  to connect to a VCR and record the video no audio I would only recommend this if you want a digital camera for a bargain price  ,1,I using camera year hence comment first look usage several month If looking camera best dollar per pixel value winner But looking convenience durability good quality picture light condition keep away Takes good picture daylight one work hard get non shaken picture poor light condition Battery life average The

won t waste your time repeating it  But I will give you my impression of this little beauty I have owned many cameras in my day  From Brownies to Leica s  I count 30  cameras owned over the years  I m not exactly young  I ve had pre war German cameras with great lenses  SLR s from most of the major Japanese Manufacturers  and smaller cameras the past 20 years  because the quality of their pictures had improved enough to make it desirable to use a more portable device to take photographs  I went to a seminar some years ago that had digital photography as its subject  I decided the product was nowhere near film quality and rejected the technology as premature  Well  it snuck up on me while I wasn t looking  When the density of the picture reached 3 4 or 5MP the digital age had arrived Several months ago I decided to buy a digital camera  I required that it take as good a picture as my 35MM Minox and Olympus  two rangefinder cameras that have given me great service  It had to be small enough to be able to be carried in a pocket  It had to have an excellent  auto  ability as well as a significant ability to adjust settings  It also had to be affordable  After reading all the reviews  and seeing the cameras in the stores  I initially focused on the Olympus C50  5MP and relatively pricey  The Olympus C4000  4MP and not very portable  and the Olympus D550  3MP  minimal adjusting ability and mixed reviews  I kept deferring my decision to buy  When sale prices started settling down I found that the Canon S30 was pricing itself near the C4000  and it had a Li Ion battery and charger included to boot  The more I thought about the S30  the better it looked  It is small enough to pocket yet not too small to handle  It has an excellent lens  The metal body is very durable  and beautiful  Also  Canon provides a great tutorial on its web site as well as updates for software and camera firmware  The cost  A major electronics discount store  probably having a slow week  met some internet prices I showed them   Bought it for  350 00  new and unopened But I haven t told you how I feel about this product  It s a jewel  The feel of it  The look of it  The sound of it  And it works better than I ever expected  A 16MB Compact Flash Card is not enough only because once the camera is in your hands you must take pictures  No problem  64MB costs about  20 00 now and you can reuse it 1 000 000 times  they say  The battery recharges in about an hour and even the charger is an elegant little device It s not usual for me to get emotional over an inanimate object  Last time was over a Mooney 201  small aircraft  If you choose this one you may just get hooked  March Update  On EBAY  I purchased 64MB of Compact Flash memory for  21 00    3 00 s h  from BRANDENBURKHART  I also purchased an NB 2L battery for  12 00    5 95 s h  from EFORCETRADING  THEY BOTH WORK PERFECTLY  ,1,I professional photographer Not even amateur expert But I know quality

428,Camera, After 3 months of use  including quick shots in all kinds of lighting during the holidays  I now believe digital cameras can replace the 35mm SLR for most users  First to some concerns others have noted  You can save your desired settings as defaults for the next time you turn on the camera  see All Reset in the Mode Setup menu  While the LCD image of a picture tends to look over exposed at times  the pictures actually saved and viewed or printed have been excellent  Getting a SmartMedia Reader on my Win ME computer  images processed by Picture It  and printed via an HP ink jet have been no problems  8x10 s of a variety of 2 and 3 MB images have been impressive  The flash is not as good as an external unit on my SLR  but is still quite adequate for the typical inside family shots  Fill flash and long flash off exposures work well  The fast lens is invaluable  I had no problems with the remote control  Battery life has been very good  I use the LCD most of the time to get the image framed properly  The reassurance of AA s working in a pinch is nice  The 128MB non OEM Smart Media card works perfectly  I have found the menus and controls quite reasonable  Study the menu structure via the LCD  a button turns it on  and practice  I haven t found any meaningful errors in the manual  but some of the exposure compensation adjustments  with vs without flash  are not clear  Everyone would arrange the menu structure differently  I wish some adjustments were built into the mode dial and back buttons instead of where they are in the menus  I fastened the lens cap with the included strap and have trained myself to always take it off before turning the camera mode dial from OFF to P  on  since the lens extends  All in all these are minor learning experiences and issues for an excellent camera  ,1,After 3 month use including quick shot kind lighting holiday I believe digital camera replace 35mm SLR user First concern others noted You save desired setting default next time turn camera see All Reset Mode Setup menu While LCD image picture tends look exposed time picture actually saved viewed printed excellent Getting SmartMedia Reader Win ME computer image processed Picture It printed via HP ink jet problem 8x10 variety 2 3 MB image impressive The flash good external unit SLR still quite adequate typical inside family shot Fill flash long flash exposure work well The fast lens invaluable I problem remote control Battery life good I use LCD time get image framed properly The reassurance AA working pinch nice The 128MB non OEM Smart Media card work perfectly I found menu control quite reasonable Study menu structure via LCD button turn practice I found meaningful error manual exposure compensation adjustment v without flash clear Everyone would arrange menu structure differently I wish adjustment built mode dial back button instead menu I fastened lens cap included strap trained always take turning camera mode dial OFF P since lens extends All minor learning experience issue excellent camera,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]",0.7818849202951775
429,Camera, Let me preface this review by saying that I would never spend  900 on a camera  digital or otherwise  I don t have the money for that  My wife and I received this camera as a gift from her parents last Christmas   An extremely generous gift  you might say  Well  you are correct  In any event  we were pleasantly surprised to be given this camera  Let me explain the camera to you very briefly from a non professional photographer s point of view The Camera has a great shape to it  It s small and light and fits nicely into your hand  It is very aesthetically pleasing  It s silver surface and large zoom lens attract attention whenever i take it out  When turned on  there are 3 options Play  Still  and Movie  In Play mode you are able to view all of the pictures currently stored on your memory stick  You can do this by jogging through each picture 1 by 1 or by scrolling through an index  The pictures only take about 3 seconds to load on the screen  so patience is not required  In Still mode you are able to take still pictures  The features that the camera offers are so numerous that I wouldnt do them all justice  Besides  many of them are beyond my scope of need as a casual photographer  It is very simple to switch between color  B W  Sepia  and Negative effects using the on screen menu  The flash bulb pops up with the slide of a switch  When you press the little silver button to take a picture there is an audible  click  that you hear that lets you know you have taken a picture  In Movie mode  you are able to shoot MPEG movies  I have only used this feature once with mixed results  The Camera actually captured the sound well  as i was taping my wife singing  The video was not the best quality  but i m sure if i played with the settings i could get it to be better Let me recap the pros and cons with this camera for you PRO the camera looks great  is lightweight  and feels good and stable in your hands PRO For the first time user  the camera is easy to operate  just turn on  put in STILL mode  and press the shutter button PRO The USB cable  supplied with camera  has worked great for me  Pictures are uploaded to my computer at a rate of about 3 15 seconds per picture  depending on what resolution you have it set on PRO The highest resolution lets you take clear  crisp  8 5x11s  The lowest setting still gives you clear 3x5 s PRO The camera shuts itself off after 5 minutes of no use so you dont waste the battery PRO  The MGI Photosuite software that came with the camera has been very clutch for me  It works great and i use it a lot CON The price  This bad boy is gonna run you at least 900 bucks  If you got the money  then i by all means recommend it  If you re scrapped for cash  you might do better getting a  50 cheapy at Wal Mart  CON The Manual is alright  but i thought it could have been better written  There are alot of features that i havent explored with mine for fear of mining through the manual for the information CON No case  They include a brochure featuring a nice case you can buy for around 40 bucks  But after paying all that money for the camera  its like a small slap in the face CON The memory stick included is only 8MB  this didnt affect me because my in laws included a 32MB stick with our present that is more than adequate  I can take 50 pictures at a mid level resolution and still have space left  If i only had 8MB i would be annoyed CON  The battery does tend to run out pretty fast  but i like the meter which lets you accurately know how long you have left  If Sony would have included a second battery  they would have added a ton of value to this product CON  The flash is extremely bright  Maybe there s a setting where i can change that  but i havent found it yet  almost every pic i take with the flash makes the subjects look as if they have not been in sunlight for 2 3 years  I often take pictures w o it and then enhance the pictures and brighten them using the software supplied

Army in 1993  Needless to say  a digital camera is just what I needed We decided to purchase a camera with part of our income tax refund  We didn t know what brand we were going to buy just yet  but we didn t want to spend over  300 We went to our PX on post and saw the Polaroid PDC700 at  249 00  It s got a maximum resolution of 1024x768  and an auto timer  Most other cameras in this price range I ve seen only have 640x480  It doesn t  however  have zoom on it  It came with a 4 meg memory card  4 batteries  camera to computer cable  camera to TV cable  camera case  wrist strap  ac power adapter  ac power adapter cord  Polaroid PhotoMAX Image Maker Software CD Rom  and Polaroid PhotoMAX Pro Software CD Rom I ve played with it alot in the last few days  and I m very satisfied with the pictures  I ve heard a few people complain about the image quality  but I have to disagree  While it may not be up to par for a professional photographer  for everyone else  I d say the image quality is great It also comes with an LCD screen to preview your pictures  and either keep or delete them  Keep in mind  the images will look better on your computer screen than they do in the LCD screen  That s not to say that the LCD screen is bad  It s just smaller  and pictures look a BIT grainier than they do on our computer monitor The software included with this camera is really fun  too  You can touch up the pictures  and add special effects if you d like to  There are alot of effects  some of which are embossing  oil painting  and mosaic I also really like the sleek  expensive look of this camera  It s silvery gold  and dark grey  and quite compact  Small enough  in fact  that the camera case has loops on the back so that you can slip it onto a belt  This is nice for people who are in busy areas  and might be worried about it being stolen  Personally  I m going to sew a heavy duty strap to the inside  so I can wear it like a purse  since I don t wear belts The ONLY slightly negative thing about this camera is that the batteries don t last long  Ours lasted a day  but keep in mind  we shot ALOT of pictures  We ve learned that when we are in the house  we need to use the AC adapter  and save the batteries for when there aren t any plugs around  I would recommend getting 2 sets of rechargable batteries  so that while you use one set  the other is always charging  thus cutting down on the cost of batteries All in all  I m very happy with the price  performance  and image quality of this camera  It was the least expensive I had found  and was nicer than the other more expensive ones I had looked at  This is one purchase I definitely won t regret br br  ,1,I purchased digital camera I bad developing film I currently 20 roll laying around house waiting developed

477,Auto, I bought my new 04 Special Edition Jeep Grand Cherokee only about 2 weeks ago and have only 1000 miles on it  So far  everything is great and I look forward to driving it every day  The Special Edition offers a nicer trim package with color side moldings  no plastic on the outside  a better stereo  fog lights  and an upper console information system  gas mileage  temperature  compass  etc  I live in Atlanta so I opted for the six cylinder engine with two wheel drive  I m no speed demon and I don t intend on getting my new Jeep dirty by going off road  I love the way the Cherokee handles on the roads  it s tight and very responsive  The engine is very quiet along with the overall ride of the Jeep  I was very impressed by the low wind noise I was expecting to get on my first test drive  All the controls are at easy reach and easy to read and operate  I like the delay feature on the rear window wiper  my last SUV only had on and off  The stereo has an amazing sound that fills up the cabin with extreme clarity  it makes my drive time more enjoyable  The Cherokee has plenty of storage compartments to offer and I especially like that they put the full size spare tire on the inside of the vehicle so in case of a flat  you re not outside trying to down reel a dirty tire from underneath  Both the rear hatch and glass open separately which can be a blessing when hauling larger items  One thing I don t care for is the way you have to pull up the back seat in order to fold down the back rest so it lays flat  You have to take the headrests off  find a place to put them for a moment  pull up the seat cushion  pull down the back rest  and then place the headrests in their small slots to be stored  Jeep could have taken a lesson from some of the other domestic engineers and figured a way to pull one lever and have everything move forward and lay flat in one motion  The only other complaint I have is where the window and door lock controls are placed on the door panels  I felt it would be easier if they could place them further toward the dash so it would be easier to operate  Other than the two complaints I have listed above  I can t find anything I don t like about my new Jeep  The gas mileage was a bit better then what I expected so I really don t have any complaints in that area  This is an SUV so if gas consumption is an issue for you  don t buy any SUV  Like I said  I am very impressed with the mileage I am receiving so far  As you can tell by now  I am no serious review writer but I can tell you that I am very happy with my new Jeep  I hope to get many years of enjoyment out of it  ,0,I bought new 04 Special Edition Jeep Grand Cherokee 2 week ago 1000 mile So far everything great I look forward driving every day The Special Edition offer nicer trim package color side molding plastic outside better stereo fog light upper console information system gas mileage temperature compass etc I live Atlanta I opted six cylinder engine two wheel drive I speed demon I intend getting new Jeep dirty going road I love way Cherokee handle road tight responsive The engine quiet along overall ride Jeep I impressed low wind noise I expecting get first test drive All control easy reach easy read operate I like delay feature rear window wiper last SUV The stereo amazing sound fill cabin extreme clarity make drive time enjoyable The Cherokee plenty storage compartment offer I especially like put full size spare tire inside vehicle case flat outside trying reel dirty tire underneath Both rear hatch glass open separately blessing hauling larger item One thing I care way pull back seat order fold back rest lay flat You take headrest find place put moment pull seat cushion pull back rest place headrest small slot stored Jeep could taken lesson domestic engineer figured way pull one lever everything move forward lay flat one motion The complaint I window door lock control placed door panel I felt would easier could place toward dash would easier operate Other two complaint I listed I find anything I like new Jeep The gas mileage bit better I expected I really complaint area This SUV gas consumption issue buy SUV Like I said I impressed mileage I receiving far As tell I serious review writer I tell I happy new Jeep I hope get many year enjoyment,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 26, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]",-1.2272829896496804

510,Auto, I have found my inner child  and he s a thirteen year old boy  This is a tremendous discovery for someone s mother to make  if you ask me  but I think it s true  The whole thing started because my old Mazda RX 7 needed work  A lot of work  I owned the car outright  but it had reached the age where it was going to take thousands of dollars a couple of times a year to keep it driving anything like I wanted  Despite argument from my significant other  my emotional attachment to the RX 7   my first ever fun car   was such that I really did plan to just keep fixing it again and again  or else replace it with a newer RX 7 if I could find one  Well  just as I was about to finally bite the bullet and get major transmission work done on the RX 7  my main squeeze threw me and our two year old son in his van  and took me out to a car lot where  side by side  sat a used Corvette and a newer RX 7 turbo  I test drove the RX 7  and found it similar to the one I already had  only with absolutely zero cargo space  I planned to test drive the Vette  but they d locked the keys in the car  Inspired  though  I headed to the Chevy dealership to see if they had any used Vettes  And they did   but not in my price range  To my surprise  though  the showroom floor Camaro SS was available at a price I could talk myself into  Giggling a little inside  I took a Camaro SS for a test drive  I was surprised by how much I liked it  Tons of zip  enough cargo space to pick up a reasonable load of groceries if I needed to  comfortable seats that were even big enough for my son s car seat  if only I liked the way it looked  I thanked the Chevy dealer for the test drive  and headed up the street to the Pontiac dealer  where I found a bargain  a low miles  bright red 1995 Trans Am  six speed with the Hurst shifters  half the price of the new Camaro SS  So I took that one for a ride too First of all  I have bad knees  So a few years ago  I came to grips with the notion that I wouldn t be driving stick anymore  It had been years  but it came right back driving that fun car  a little slow stop and start around surface streets  then out onto the highway and next thing I know  there I am in 6th  severely over the speed limit at 1500 rpm  I took the car out of gear  got off the freeway  and went back to the dealership  angel on one shoulder saying  quot But remember  you can t drive stick anymore  remember your knees shaking in traffic quot  and devil on the other saying   quot Who cares  Who CARES  This car RULES quot  This  like I say  is where the teenage boy comes in I looked at every Trans Am on that lot  Unlike the Camaros  they didn t have any automatics in stock  I worked that dealer  had him showing me every little feature of every Trans Am  and then I got back in the aged RX 7 and  responsibly  drove home without buying a stick But back at the house  I started my Trans Am research in earnest  I was intrigued to compare Firebirds and Camaros  learning that more Camaros are made than Firebirds  that a larger percentage of women buy Firebirds than Camaros  while the opposite is true of Camaros  I walked around for a few days saying things like  quot Hey  it s a version of the Corvette engine quot  and  quot I think traction control would be a major plus quot  and  quot Okay  can you explain the difference between gear ratio and axle ratio quot Just like that  I d managed to tell myself I could sever my emotional bond with my RX 7  and I knew that I wanted to replace it with a hefty American V8  For a new  sporty car  that meant I had 3 options  Firebird  Camaro  or Mustang  For a slightly used car  a Corvette Frankly  I just don t like the looks of the new Mustang at all  And to get the same horsepower that are standard with a Camaro or Firebird  I would have had to spring for a Mustang SVT Cobra  with a higher sticker price than I wanted to pay for a car whose looks I don t like  and which I constantly see lots of on the road anyway  What s more  I fail to see why the absolute top of the line Mustang  the SVT Cobra R  actually gets any play when you could buy a new Corvette for the same price  People actually pick a Mustang over a Vette  Ford must have some advertising whizzes  But naaaah  the Mustang was never a contender for me The used Corvette was  However  after a fair amount of contemplation  I decided that what I really wanted to do was buy my first brand new car  where I got to pick out the colour and everything  and it came with a solid warranty and no miles on it and it would be mine from the very beginning  So  back to Camaro vs  Firebird  First of all  the base V6 was right out  I m sure it s a great car  but after driving the 305 horsepower V8s  I had to have one  I didn t even bother to test drive the 200 horsepower V6 Firebird or Camaro  If I d been in the market for a V6  however  either the Camaro or the Firebird would have been a hands down win over the V6 Mustang  which I ve rented and  frankly  enjoyed less than a Camry   which is too bad  because I wanted to like the Mustang  Deciding between the Camaro and Firebird ended up being easier than one might think  While I liked the way the Camaro handled  and its features and options  and while the price was right and there were plenty of Camaro SSes around that were automatic transmission  the bottom line is I liked the looks of the Trans Am better  It took me the better part of a week to find an automatic Trans Am to test drive  to be sure I liked the way the automatic transmission felt  Deep down  the teenage boy inside me kept hollering the whole time   quot You don t care  So what about your knees  Get this one  Get it  Get it  Yeah  Don t drive the dying RX 7 off this lot quot When I finally found one  it was an automatic Trans Am with the WS6 performance package on it  and it was a 2001  which meant I wouldn t be able to take advantage of the  1500 rebate for the 2000 model year  and the bottom line there was that the car was just a little more expensive than I really wanted to pay  for features that I wasn t likely to ever really capitalize on   17 quot  wheels  15 more horses  and the functional scoops with tougher looking hood  for example I ended up picking out an automatic Trans Am to be delivered from about a hundred miles away  with the only options being chromed wheels  traction control  and the  quot performance axle quot  with the 3 23 ratio  While the waiting for the car to be delivered was sheer torture  I could not be happier with the vehicle First of all  I m thrilled with its pure oomph  I m learning to drive all over again   if I drive this car the way I drove the RX 7  I m going to get arrested  Step anything but lightly on the accelerator when the light turns green  and the tires will squeal  This car is very quick off the line   the same kind of driving that would keep me reasonably in step with other cars before now leaves me seeing them far back in the rear view mirror  Of course  this means I ve got to be vigilant if I m not the first one up at the light   Pickup is exceptional  even at highway speeds  This means the car really is terrific in California freeway traffic  if I need to be somewhere else  fast  it s no problem  It s great to have the power to accelerate out of potentially sticky situations even when the overall flow of traffic is already exceeding the speed limit  I m also very happy with braking  since I don t have downshifting for an added measure of control  in an automatic  and the car s overall responsiveness  Take a week of Silicon Valley driving  and you re guaranteed a few chances to find out how your car reacts to adverse traffic scenarios  While I ve heard complaints about visibility  I have to say it s superior to what I had in the RX 7  Yes  the rear window is short  so you don t get a tall view of the road there  and that takes some getting used to  as does seeing the rear spoiler in the reflection  However  the side mirrors are excellent  and the glance over the shoulder blind spot is much smaller than the one I had with the RX 7  which was enough of a blind spot to hide an entire Geo Metro  ask me how I learned that one  I didn t get the driver s seat with lumbar support  just the basic 6 way power seat  If I were expecting to do nonstop roadtrips  or if I already had back problems  I would likely have opted for the upgraded seat  but I m perfectly happy with this one  and suspect I would be even for the occasional roadtrip  However  I expect a passenger would want to make more frequent stops to stretch his legs  given the lump in the floor which I understand hides the catalytic converter  and no one but a child could make a roadtrip in this vehicle as a back seat passenger Speaking of children  my son s toddler car seat fits quite nicely in the back  and there are tether strap anchor points for two car seats  While I think his view was better from the passenger seat of the two seater RX 7  in the Trans Am he can watch all the mirrors and has the view out the tinted glass T tops  Although he does tend to kick the passenger seat some  he s got enough room to be comfortable  and his major problem appears to be when we stop   he will start screaming   quot Go  Go  Go  car quot  I also find that it s nice to be able to reach easily to hand him things and so forth  without having to tell him to keep his hand off the shifter and not kick the stereo  like in a 2 seater  And of course  I love it that now all three people in our family can go for a ride in the fun car at once  The stereo is great  I did not opt for the 12 CD changer  figuring that if I do someday decide I want one  I can probably find one that will work with the car s head unit for under  600  the price of the factory installed changer  I m definitely going to get spoiled by the radio controls on the steering wheel  too I m thrilled with the T tops as an open air alternative to a convertible  Lots more openness than even a huge power moonroof gave me on the RX 7  and little enough wind turbulence that  even though I have three feet of hair  I am comfortable and hair doesn t get blown in my face  restricting my vision  An equally long haired passenger reported the same thing  I ve been advised  about the T tops  to unlatch them in the event that the car ever needs to be jacked up  so as to avoid any potential torque being applied to that part of the car  which could result in a leaky T top  By the same token  the manual says never to take the car through a car wash that sprays high pressure water in the area of the T tops  so it looks like this will be a wash by hand car forever  What s more  the manual says the chromed wheels are prone to damage by brushes in a car wash  so I guess I ll be washing it and making periodic visits to the upscale car detailers  Though classified as a sub compact  this is a bigger car than you would think  It s nearly as long as my main squeeze s extended GMC Safari  and weighing in at 3500 pounds  almost as much as a Coupe DeVille and more than a Chevy S 10 pickup   this car weighs as much as some SUVs  So you can t drive it like you would a lightweight vehicle  Nor does this vehicle get subcompact gas mileage  for Silicon Valley traffic driving  admittedly with the air conditioning on  I seem to be getting about 17 miles to the gallon The list of standard features on a Trans Am is truly exceptional  especially for the price  No  it doesn t have the full complement of luxury sedan features  but one wouldn t expect it to  But the list of standard equipment is long enough that it barely fits in the section for it on the car s window sticker  Overall  I would wholeheartedly recommend this car to anyone who wants a fun  fast car  with a few caveats  you won t be able to fit a huge amount of cargo in it  though it s got adequate space  you won t be able to carry around a gaggle of your friends  and it will be anything but cheap to fill it with the premium gas the manual sternly recommends  Additionally  I would not recommend this car to an inexperienced driver  The steep rake angle of the hood makes it hard to get a feel for where the car ends  and similarly  it s hard to know this moving in reverse  Further  with the major amount of oomph right at all speeds I ve driven so far  and a top speed that s supposed to be 160 MPH  I would not recommend this for a driver who is inexperienced or prone to recklessness   which is bad news  I suppose  for teenage boys who aren t inner children br br  ,0,I found inner child thirteen year old boy This tremendous discovery someone mother make ask I think true The whole thing started old Mazda RX 7 needed work A lot work I owned car outright reached age going take thousand

513,Camera, I was looking for a replacement for my Nikon 950 a long time ago and wanted to try something else  The Canon S20 was the smallest 3 3Mpel camera I could find  and did not look as  clunky  as the nikon coolpix 990 There were a few signs of trouble from the beginning  1  I find the flash was even weaker than the old nikon950 which was itself not bright enough  Taking pictures indoors or at night is not worth the effort if your room light is low  Pictures always comes out bad 2  It takes non std batteries that don t last as long  The old nikon950 took AA s so I could get 1500mAH NiMH rechargeables cheaply and they last long enough for me to fill a 128MB CF outdoors if I switched off the monitor  This one requires a  100 rechargeable battery that WILL not even fill half of a 128MB CF  This means you really need two of them for a proper session  IE  we are talking  200 extra for batteries here instead of  25 for AA NiMH and charger 3  When viewed on a screen  the extra pixels did not make the pictures any better than my old Nikon coolpix 950  In fact  when I took similar material in bright sunlight   I saw that the pictures look either too blue or too red  but the color was definitely off here If I didn t already own a nikon coolpix 950  I would have thought this was a great camera  but I did  so this is not a good one to buy  Spend a little more and get a better camera I was disappointed with this camera  and will probably get another brand when I upgrade  perhaps a higher res Nikon  ,1,I looking replacement Nikon 950 long time ago wanted try something else The Canon S20 smallest 3 3Mpel camera I could find look clunky nikon coolpix 990 There sign trouble beginning 1 I find flash even weaker old nikon950 bright enough Taking picture indoors night worth effort room light low Pictures always come bad 2 It take non std battery last long The old nikon950 took AA I could get 1500mAH NiMH rechargeables cheaply last long enough fill 128MB CF outdoors I switched monitor This one requires 100 rechargeable battery WILL even fill half 128MB CF This mean really need two proper session IE talking 200 extra battery instead 25 AA NiMH charger 3 When viewed screen extra pixel make picture better old Nikon coolpix 950 In fact I took similar material bright sunlight I saw picture look either blue red color definitely If I already nikon coolpix 950 I would thought great camera I good one buy Spend little get better camera I disappointed camera probably get another brand I upgrade perhaps higher re Nikon,"[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 12, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1]",-0.6867758330633655

539,Camera, My wife bought me this camera a few weeks before our baby was born so that we could instantly share pictures of our first born to family that is spread throughout the country  She knows my penchant for researching all purchases  so presented me with the  quot O K quot  to go buy one after doing my research So  to the internet  epinions of course  and to a local camera store  Camera World  I went  Why did I end up with the   Fuji FinePix 1400 i b  Price  functionality and quality b Price  Retail for the FinePix 1400 is  290  but I found it at the Chase Manhattan shopping site for  190  Even with a couple of upgrades  32MB Flash Card  8 rechargeable batteries and a charger  my price was still under the retail price  My wife had put me on a  300 budget  so this was perfect for me  I found that digital cameras run in the  200    900 range  I was very surprised that my  190 bought such a fine camera b Features  The Fuji FinePix 1400 comes standard with the following i 3x Autofocus Power Zoom    Perfectly fine for any indoor household type zooming needs  Not great for trying to zoom in on a wide receiver on a football field  however i 4MB SmartMedia Storage Card    This only holds about 15 or 18 pictures  so unless you download pictures after every picture taking session  you ll want to upgrade this to a 32MB version  You can find a 32MB Card for about  50 on eBay  and this will hold about 150 pictures  More than enough to get you through several photo sessions i 1280 x 960 Image File Resolution    Good resolution for pictures up to 5x7  If you re interested in blowing your pictures up to 8x10 or larger  I d recommend a camera with a higher resolution  However  I m perfectly happy with the FinePix s resolution for my everyday internet sharing purposes  I have developed one of the pictures in 8x10 format  and although it looks good from a distance  you can really see the pixels up close i 1 6 inch Liquid Crystal Display    Awesome  You take a picture and 1 2 second later it is shown on this incredibly sharp display  Not only that  but you can choose to view from this so you can take pictures without having your eye directly on the viewfinder  It s like a little video camera  but not recording  When viewing a picture  you can zoom in and out and the display exposes new levels of detail upon each closer zoom   Multi Frame Playback Feature    Lots and lots of options on how to view pictures  One by one  thumbnails  zoomed in  zoomed out  etc  You can also lock photos so they aren t inadvertently deleted  Navigating through the pictures is very easy  and the buttons to do so are clearly marked and large enough to accommodate large fingers i USB enabled    This is very important to get  Do not buy serial cable cameras  as it takes FOREVER to port to a computer  The USB cable is lightening fast  To view the 120 pictures on my camera right now  it only takes about 3 seconds for all to load  The software Fuji provides is simple to install and simple to use  Consists of a driver for Windows 98 or Windows 2000  a photo editor and a photo viewer  I ve never used the photo editor  however  because I m a fan of Microsoft s PhotoDraw 2000 Version 2 0  PhotoDraw has more than enough to alter enhance crop digital photographs b Batteries  Don t even think of using regular batteries with this camera  or any digital camera  The Liquid Crystal Display will eat through 4 AA batteries in a matter of minutes  You should invest in the  25 40 for a battery charger and nickel cadmium batteries  I suggest you buy 8 batteries so you always have a back up set handy  You can get a great deal on eBay for a package deal  charger and batteries  for about  35 usually b Conclusion  I m very happy with the Fuji FinePix

540,Camera, I was in my local camera shop a few days ago looking for a small carrying case for my new digital camera  I spend more time in photo and electronics stores than the average Canon representative  and I was chatting with a friendly salesman about digital cameras  I had barely noticed the middle aged man standing a few yards away staring blankly into a showcase  The salesman excused himself from our conversation  and went to proffer assistance to this gentleman  Our mystery man responded   quot No  thanks  but I d like to talk to YOU  if you don t mind quot  pointing a friendly finger in my direction  As it turned out  this stranger  Chris  he introduced himself  had just purchased the new Sony DSC F505V digital camera  and wanted to pay me  60 to spend 3 hours showing him how to use the camera  He turned out to be an ex wedding photographer  turned photo hobbyist who had just made his first foray into digital photography  As an avid photographer  I figured it would make for a good Epinions review  plus I can never turn down an offer to play with new technology  so off we went to the streets of New Jersey for a little photographic adventure  I also took my 3 month old Nikon Coolpix 990 with me to see how it would stand up to Sony s newest competitor  Chris pulled out his manual while I played with the controls  and by the time he had read over the first 3 pages  I had the camera figured out  This was not completely attributable to my camera skills  I must admit  Sony has done a nice job laying out the controls with good access to menus and fast access to basic functions  After spending what turned out to be 5 hours learning  teaching  and photographing with the DSC F505V  I can say that Sony came pretty close to producing a great camera Let s start with the Sony s strong points  The Carl Zeiss lens produces excellent results with great color saturation  The 5 times optical zoom provides great range  though it operates a little slowly  and makes it much more versatile in telephoto situations  up to the 35mm equivalent of 190mm  This digicam wins points in my book by including a good amount of creative control  and I love the manual focusing ring at the front of the lens  All was going well on our photo shoot when suddenly the digipoo hit the fan  Fifty minutes into the afternoon and already the freshly charged lithium ion battery was dead  Luckily he had the good sense to spend an additional  50 for a spare battery  but with a two hour charge time  Sony includes 1 battery and the charger  and less than an hour s operation  we had encountered the DSC F505V s first weakness  This flaw is worsened by the fact that you cannot use any other types of batteries in the unit  and since there is no viewfinder  there is no way of saving power by turning off the display  After another hour s use  some intense reading  of both the manual and some reviews  and uploading the images to a computer  other flaws began to surface  The included 8MB MemoryStick filled up very quickly  for  1000  Sony should have included a 16MB card  The manual is virtually impossible to follow  and the camera is a little too bulky for it s features  Flash performance was also a little below average  and I thought Sony should have included a more versatile set of metering options  center weighted and spot are your only choices  I also think that Sony slightly misrepresented the DSC F505V by advertising it as a 3 7 megapixel camera  What the camera actually does is use a 3 3 MP  2048x1536  CCD  which is partly blocked from the lens by the camera s design  This means the camera is only actually capturing 2 7 megapixels  1856x1392  What the camera then does  albeit better than some earlier digital cameras  is interpolate the image out to 2240 by 1680  creating a 3 7 megapixel image  This final image does not produce quite as good a result as true 3 34 megapixel camera When the second battery died  55 minutes out of this one  I showed Chris my Coolpix 990  check out my user page for a complete review  After an hour or so he had the basic functions down  and he was enamored with the Nikon s swivel head and control system  We talked about some of the obvious advantages  true 3 34 megapixel resolution  compact design  pro features  inclusion of a viewfinder  and the ability to use AA batteries  and it was a no brainer for him  Right then  we drove to the store where he bought the DSC F505V  and exchanged it for their second to last Nikon 990  I talked to him again several days later  and he was as thrilled with his new Coolpix as I was br br  ,1,I local camera shop day ago looking small carrying case new digital camera I spend time photo electronics store average Canon representative I chatting friendly

544,Camera, I was never that interested in getting a digital camera  Yeah  I thought they looked nice and the concept was good  They were always too expensive though  For my birthday this year my girlfriend EpinionID Mookasaurs  bought me the Kodak Millenium Edition camera The Millenium package came with an 8 Mb picture card and a USB Removable disk  The 8 Mb card will hold about 26 pictures with this camera  Very similar to the 25 pictures I was accustomed too with my advantix  I wasn t quite content with that  When I go places I usually bring a couple rolls of film  For use around the house 8 Mb is plenty  I can take 26 pictures  load them on my hard drive and go for another round  If I m away though I can do that  I was able to acquire a 32 Mb picture card and now I have plenty of storage for my pictures  This card will hold 113 pictures at the highest resolution and over 250 at the lowest  I ve even heard that there is a 196 Mb picture card out  that s just amazing The removable disk is very convenient  It looks like a little mouse  It connects into a USB port in your computer and you can slide your picture disk into the slot  This is much more convenient than hooking the camera up to the computer every time you want to read the disk  The setup for this was really easy and I was so close to being able to do it without the directions  Of course my mom always says  people get paid good money to write those directions Enough about the gizmos and gadgets  I m sure you want to know about the camera  The camera is extremely easy to use  I still haven t had to crack open the instruction booklet yet  It only takes a few minutes to set the time  date and any other settings like resolution  Put the picture card in and you re ready to go  For those who are use to a regular camera you ll notice that the digital camera is much heavier  Part of this is because of the 4 AA batteries required to operate the camera  Flip the power on  set the camera to capture mode  aim and shoot  The picture will then come up on the LCD screen on the back of the camera  You have the option to delete it if you want  I suggest you don t delete pictures till you need the space  Even bad pictures are nice to look at later on in life  You can always download them to your computer and not have to worry about them taking space on your picture card  You can also set the camera to review mode and look at all of the pictures you have taken so far  You re allowed to delete pictures in this mode also The camera has three different flash modes  On  off and red eye reduction  The flash is extremely bright so don t look directly into the light  There is also a timer on the camera so you can set it down and get into the picture yourself  The zoom lens on the camera is a very nice feature to take close ups  There are a couple of downsides to the digital camera  With regular cameras you can take pictures one after the other  The digital camera has like a 10 second pause where it is writing the picture to the disk  This can cause you to miss some good pictures  It also chews up batteries at a good rate  I ve gone through a set of batteries already in just three weeks  The only other problem I can see is the inconvenience of having to get pictures developed  All of the options there are to get them developed seem really expensive Overall I suggest investing in one of these cameras  You can email all your pictures to friends and family  put them on your web site or just keep them on your computer for your personal viewing br br  ,1,I never interested getting digital camera Yeah I thought looked nice concept good They always expensive though For birthday year girlfriend EpinionID Mookasaurs bought Kodak Millenium Edition camera The

suggest delete picture till need space Even bad picture nice look later life You always download computer worry taking space picture card You also set camera review mode look picture taken far You allowed delete picture mode also The camera three different flash mode On red eye reduction The flash extremely bright look directly light There also timer camera set get picture The zoom lens camera nice feature take close ups There couple downside digital camera With regular camera take picture one The digital camera like 10 second pause writing picture disk This cause miss good picture It also

559,Camera, I ve been dying for a digital camera for years  and an online friend picked up a little  50 Vivitar at Wal Mart that took AWESOME pics  I researched it online  and while doing so the Vivitar 3615 caught my eye  my husband and I decided that we should  splurge  and get the more expensive model  We haven t regretted it since  It takes very clear pics in either high or low resolution mode  although I can t really tell the difference  in low res mode you will be able to take more pics before uploading them  The manual says it can hold around 86 pics  but when we took pics of the fireworks on July 4  I had over 130 in the camera  And that s without any additional storage card  Pictures upload quickly  and you have the option of selecting changing your file for uploading to  you can also have the computer delete the pics from the camera once they re uploaded  The LCD viewscreen is very clear  the only problem I have with it is that it gets in the way of my nose when I m trying to use the viewfinder  so I end up either cleaning the screen after each picture or holding my head at an awkward angle while I m taking pictures The batteries don t seem to last too long  but being rechargeables I expected that  I invested in an additional set of batteries and a rapid charger  total cost   30  so I always have a fully charged set on hand  plus a pack of alkalines in case of emergency  Once in a while  if the camera is jarred too hard the batteries will shift and cause the camera s time date settings to reset  I also get the occasional blurry pic  but that s user error  not camera defect The flash works very well  almost TOO well in many conditions  I was playing with my 6 YO daughter  and took a picture of her in a completely dark room  the flash made it appear that she was in a well lit room  Often I get pics where my subject  usually my cats  are washed out because it s too bright  but I get enough good quality pics that I can overlook the few bad ones Overall  I would highly recommend this camera  whether you re a first time digital buyer or on a budget  I do plan on getting a different one in the future  hopefully with video camera mode  but I assure you  I will not get rid of this one  I have already saved hundreds of dollars on film  this camera pays for itself in a short period of time  It s wonderful  ,1,I dying digital camera year online friend picked little 50 Vivitar Wal Mart took AWESOME pic I researched online Vivitar 3615 caught eye husband I decided splurge get expensive model We regretted since It take clear pic either high low resolution mode although I really tell difference low re mode able take pic uploading The manual say hold around 86 pic took pic firework July 4 I 130 camera And without additional storage card Pictures upload quickly option selecting changing file uploading also computer delete pic camera uploaded The LCD viewscreen clear problem I get way nose I trying use viewfinder I end either cleaning screen picture holding head awkward angle I taking picture The battery seem last long rechargeables I expected I invested additional set battery rapid charger total cost 30 I always fully charged set hand plus pack alkalines case emergency Once camera jarred hard battery shift cause camera time date setting reset I also get occasional blurry pic user error camera defect The flash work well almost TOO well many condition I playing 6 YO daughter took picture completely dark room flash made appear well lit room Often I get pic subject usually cat washed bright I get enough good quality pic I overlook bad one Overall I would highly recommend camera whether first time digital buyer budget I plan getting different one future hopefully video camera mode I assure I get rid one I already saved hundred dollar film camera pay short period time It wonderful,"[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 9, 22, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]",0.8430605785865387

569,Camera,   Included in the box is the Minolta DiMAGE X20 camera  8MB memory card  2 AA batteries  a wrist and neck strap  cables for televisions and computers  two discs and instructions  Although this will depend on the place of purchase and deals  The Minolta DiMAGE X20 is very stylish  with its ultra slim body and fashionable look which will suit anyone s age  from the cool teenager to the trendy grandparents  The front looks very nice and the back contains the LCD screen and easy control buttons  The body is very sleek but not too small  When switched on  the Minolta DiMAGE X20 lights up in various places and produces a sound which is very cool  The LCD screen immediately goes into picture mode and you are ready to go  There are two main settings  picture and movie  easily changed by a switch on th top  Both are easy to use and the amount used or stored does depend on the size of memory card  The first thing to do is read the manual quickly to learn the basics then set up the menu  such as date and time  etc  There is a playback button which allows you to view all your pictures and movies One of my favourite features is the voice memo which allows you to record a voice message with each picture  which is a brilliant feature  Another is the movie mode which most cameras will have nowadays but it is good to use from time to time as I have found it quite useful  All movies can be viewed on the LCD screen or when connected to the TV The good points are its overall shape and ease of use  Its very glam and has many features  The camera uses AA batteries which is useful as rechargeable ones can be bought or they can be taken out the nearest control without missing the picture opportunity  The zoom is very good and has a bright flash  The quality and size of pictures can be adjusted to your preference and unwanted pictures or movies can be deleted easily  When connected to the computer  the memory card can be loaded onto the computer so there is more storage  The picture quality is good for the user but a professional would probably buy a more expernisive one  The price is not too bad either and deals are often around so I would suggest searching The bad points are that some things are not mentioned in the instruction book such as how to remove the voice memo from a picture  although this can be found online  Also a case is not included I would recommend buying a battery charger and spare sets of batteries incase the other ones run out  This will save money in the long term and are not expensive to buy  Buying a case will protect the camera and these can be bought anywhere This is a fantastic little camera and would recommend to anyone who is considering it  ,1,Included box Minolta DiMAGE X20 camera 8MB memory card 2 AA battery
